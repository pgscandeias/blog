I was testing it using the Postman extension for Chrome, sending POST requests to a &lt;em&gt;/users&lt;/em&gt; URI (the Restful way of creating a new user). Here's the request:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\nusername =&amp;gt; myusername\nemail =&amp;gt; email@host.tld\npassword =&amp;gt; 12345\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the controller, I bound the request to the form as usual:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\n...\n$form-&amp;gt;bind($this-&amp;gt;getRequest());\n...\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After which $form-&amp;gt;isValid() promptly failed with an empty $form-&amp;gt;getErrors().&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I spent a good chunk of time hunting down validation problems in the User entity annotations, experimenting with the CSRF token requirement, disabling the JMSSerializerBundle exclusion policies for the User entity and praying to the Gods of the Source. To no avail. I could only get the form to work by manually binding each field:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\n$form-&amp;gt;bind(array(\n'username' =&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;get('username'),\n'email'&amp;nbsp;=&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;get('email'),\n'password'&amp;nbsp;=&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;get('password'),\n));\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;By then I was pretty sure this was deep facepalm country. I find the best way to handle these kinds of situations is to take a break, so I carefully closed the laptop, called it a night and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, this morning the solution hit me as soon as I looked at the code. Quite simply, Symfony expects my POST request to have a top-level namespace matching the form's name. Given the form had the name 'user', it was a simple matter of tweaking the request:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\nuser[username] =&amp;gt; myusername\nuser[email] =&amp;gt; email@host.tld\nuser[password] =&amp;gt; 12345\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done and done.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It's hard to draw a lesson here. On one hand, this wouldn't have happened if I was using a form rendered by Symfony rather than crafting my request by hand. Since the &lt;a href=\"http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; assumes you'll be doing just that, it doesn't bother too much with explaining how things work under the veneer of the helpers and that makes life difficult when building an API that's not going to be consumed by something built with Symfony. On the other hand, maybe I could have started my debugging by having symfony build a valid form and looking at the request it produced. Then again, hindsight is 20/20.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the only sure conclusion is that, yet again, walking away from the code and coming back well rested works wonders.&lt;/p&gt;",

The objective was to consolidate my at-home time, working on personal projects first thing in the morning rather than in the evening. This makes sense because I'm rarely in the mood to be productive after a long day at the office.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I pulled it off for a while, and it was great. Days were much simpler: wake up, work on my stuff, work at the office, relax, sleep. Much better than wake up, work at the office, fret about not having the energy to work on my stuff, don't relax at all, sleep. Knowing that each day I could get work done on my own projects greatly improved my mood, which had a positive impact on my demeanor and productivity at the office too.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sadly, going out of sync relative to one's significant other is not easy. Readjusting sleep patterns is hard enough, trying to go to sleep while someone still roams around the house is harder still. By the end of the week I found myself&nbsp;somewhat sleep-deprived. I was also missing my quality time with her.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So now I'm back to old slightly chaotic routine.&lt;/div&gt;",

Or is it?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Trouble is, web development these days is all about frameworks. Take a look at the file structure of any project and you&amp;#39;ll guess the framework it is built upon before you get any clue about its purpose. This reliance on frameworks has heavily leaked into testing. Even if you&amp;#39;re just testing a Symfony2 service, you&amp;#39;re still parsing tons of yaml files and booting up the kernel and injecting dependencies and god knows what else before your service is actually tested. This slows each test quite a lot, which is troublesome if your suite runs hundreds or thousands of tests.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;TDD is based on the idea that you write your test first, just enough to prevent the suite from passing. Then you implement some code that makes the test pass. Then you refactor that code so that its cleaner and more efficient. In between these steps you should run your test suite. An entire &amp;quot;write test, run tests, write code, run tests, refactor code&amp;quot; (the Red-Green-Refactor cycle) should take no more than a couple of minutes, which is difficult when justs running the tests takes an hour.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The answer is moving application logic away from the framework.

That's because checking the weather is as easy as tapping once on the weather app icon, whereas taking a note or creating a reminder is a complex, keyboard-heavy operation.

In a time when the browser is perhaps the application we use the most, it's quite harmful to persist using a technology that's known for crashing it and slowing it down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It's true Flash is still better suited than HTML5 for certain tasks, and its ubiquity as a video player makes it unavoidable for consumers to keep running it, but the times they are a-chagnin'. If I were a Flash dev, I'd be looking at some HTML5 and JS tutorials right about now.&lt;/p&gt;",

If this had gotten any traction, facebook, google+ and foursquare feeds would also have been integrated into the system to make it more reliable. SMS notifications would be used in addition to email warnings too.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s only been two days since the launch, but the analytics panel makes for some grim reading already.

I crept out of bed, out of the warmth of Her presence, and tentatively stepped away. My idea needed to be made manifest quickly, lest it be forgotten. Treading lightly on the cold wooden floor, I made my way to the living room, sat on a couch by the window and picked up the laptop.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;As dawn came, the preliminary work was done. It was nothing but a sketch made of computer code, but it was enough. My idea had taken root. As I went back to the bedroom, my thoughts traveled a year into the past. In that same house my grandmother still dwelt. In another city, one of my dearest friends still lived. How could we possibly have known.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Less than a week has passed since that chilly Saturday morning. Work has progressed swiftly. I just uploaded a little &lt;a href=\"http://absenceletters.com\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, in fact, and created an account for myself in it. Every once in a while, a program will run on its server and send me an email. I&amp;#39;ll click a link in it and nothing will happen. One day, though, I won&amp;#39;t click on that link. I don&amp;#39;t know when or why. Surely it&amp;#39;ll be in the distant future. But it will come. And when it does, another little program will take the letters I&amp;#39;ve stored in its database and send them one by one.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;And hopefully the people I love will find some comfort in them.&lt;/div&gt;",

Treading lightly on the cold wooden floor, I made my way to the living room, sat on a couch by the window and picked up the laptop.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;As dawn came, the preliminary work was done. It was nothing but a sketch made of computer code, but it was enough. My idea had taken root. As I went back to the bedroom, my thoughts traveled a year into the past.

I just uploaded a little &lt;a href=\"http://absenceletters.com\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, in fact, and created an account for myself in it. Every once in a while, a program will run on its server and send me an email. I&amp;#39;ll click a link in it and nothing will happen. One day, though, I won&amp;#39;t click on that link. I don&amp;#39;t know when or why. Surely it&amp;#39;ll be in the distant future. But it will come. And when it does, another little program will take the letters I&amp;#39;ve stored in its database and send them one by one.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;And hopefully the people I love will find some comfort in them.&lt;/div&gt;",

A cidade estava a enlouquecer. Era muito estranha, muito estranha, a passividade de quem deveria estar a manter a ordem. Mas era ainda mais estranho que ningu&amp;eacute;m o tivesse vindo visitar &amp;agrave; sua loja de banda desenhada e artigos festivos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;A cortina deteve-se com um estrondo e o som ecoou pelos corredores vazios, demorando a extinguir-se nas profundezas da galeria comercial mal iluminada que, hoje, cheirava pior que de costume.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mas ser&amp;aacute;, realmente? Assim t&amp;atilde;o estranho?&amp;rdquo;, pensou. J&amp;aacute; n&amp;atilde;o eram os anos oitenta. Olhou para baixo, para os p&amp;eacute;s. Antigamente t&amp;ecirc;-los-ia visto, mas agora eram escondidos pela camisola, inchada como um bal&amp;atilde;o. Deu uma leve palmada no est&amp;ocirc;mago e esbo&amp;ccedil;ou um esgar, que de sorriso tinha pouco. Como o tempo passava. Como os clich&amp;eacute;s se concretizavam. Abanou a cabe&amp;ccedil;a.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Com o tilintar de chaves e um estalido, a fechadura ficou trancada. A cortina n&amp;atilde;o subiria de novo at&amp;eacute; &amp;agrave; tarde do dia seguinte. Disso o lojista tinha a certeza. N&amp;atilde;o parecia, mas era uma estrutura altamente refor&amp;ccedil;ada.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Contemplou a soma da sua vida. Tinha tomado conta da loja aos trinta anos, pensando tratar-se de um grande neg&amp;oacute;cio. Sempre tinha gostado de banda desenhada, portanto que melhor ideia que fazer disso vida? Trabalharia ali sozinho para come&amp;ccedil;ar, depois empregaria ajudantes e finalmente expandiria para outros locais. Em menos de dez anos teria liberdade financeira e poderia dedicar-se aos seus outros interesses no abundante tempo livre. Se perguntassem ao lojista onde exactamente &amp;eacute; que esse plano tinha corrido mal, ele n&amp;atilde;o saberia dizer. N&amp;atilde;o havia um momento ao qual fosse &amp;oacute;bvio apontar o dedo e dizer &amp;ldquo;foi aqui&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Suspirou. Tudo que tinha havido era uma inocente sucess&amp;atilde;o de dias, todos iguais uns aos outros. Dias que, individualmente inofensivos, tinham-se acumulado rapidamente e, de alguma forma, resultado num grande e assustador monstro feito de tempo e desapontamento. O lojista tinha hoje quase sessenta anos. Sem filhos, e com plena consci&amp;ecirc;ncia de que a loja na galeria moribunda estava a pouco tempo de desaparecer, n&amp;atilde;o deixaria grande legado.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Olhou para a esquerda, por cima do ombro, na direc&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o de uma montra esparsamente povoada por caixas velhas de videojogos. Sim, o mundo tinha mudado muito. J&amp;aacute; quase ningu&amp;eacute;m vinha &amp;agrave; sua loja pela banda desenhada, pelas figuras articuladas ou pelos jogos de tabuleiro. O pouco que vendia era pela internet, e os magros lucros disso ainda tinham que ser partilhados com o rapaz que lhe tratava da p&amp;aacute;gina, ou site, ou l&amp;aacute; como se chamava aquilo. Se n&amp;atilde;o fosse pelos artigos festivos, particularmente os pirot&amp;eacute;cnicos, estaria a viver em Passos Manuel dentro de uma caixa de cart&amp;atilde;o.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Um passo ligeiro, denunciado pelo mais leve dos sons, arrancou-o da contempla&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o e atirou-o de volta &amp;agrave; realidade. Tinha aprendido a estar atento, gra&amp;ccedil;as aos clientes que n&amp;atilde;o lhe visitavam a loja pelos super her&amp;oacute;is. Num piscar de olhos, levou a m&amp;atilde;o ao interior do sobretudo e soltou a mola do coldre que sempre o acompanhava. Agarrou a coronha e virou-se para a direita, de onde ouvira o passo. Deu com duas figuras de p&amp;eacute; &amp;agrave; sua frente, nem a tr&amp;ecirc;s metros de dist&amp;acirc;ncia. Um fedor a carne podre invadiu-lhe as narinas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Sentiu os p&amp;ecirc;los da nuca a eri&amp;ccedil;arem-se. Estava habituado a receber gente muito esquisita, mas estes dois pareciam sa&amp;iacute;dos da selva. Roupas escuras todas rasgadas, manchadas de vermelho enferrujado, revelavam uma variedade de cortes, escoria&amp;ccedil;&amp;otilde;es e feridas abertas. E aquele cheiro? Revoltava o est&amp;ocirc;mago. Teve que fazer um grande esfor&amp;ccedil;o para n&amp;atilde;o vomitar ali mesmo. Moveu os p&amp;eacute;s para manter o equil&amp;iacute;brio, vacilou e encostou-se &amp;agrave; cortina de metal em busca de apoio. Olhou melhor para os seus inesperados visitantes, que n&amp;atilde;o se mexiam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Um era moreno, de estatura m&amp;eacute;dia, e olhava-o com interesse. A outra, apoiada com evidente dificuldade no seu bra&amp;ccedil;o, era uma loira platinada cujo cabelo extremamente longo e sujo cobria o rosto. Os dedos finos e longos da sua m&amp;atilde;o direita eram brancos como giz e terminavam em unhas de um vermelho demasiado vivo. Tinha-as cravadas no bra&amp;ccedil;o do ajudante com o que parecia a &amp;uacute;ltima for&amp;ccedil;a que lhe restava. Como &amp;eacute; que aqueles dois tinham conseguido aproximar-se dele sem fazer qualquer barulho, o lojista n&amp;atilde;o percebia. Contudo, &amp;agrave; excep&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o daquele &amp;uacute;ltimo passo, permaneciam completamente silenciosos. E aquele cheiro, seria ele o &amp;uacute;nico a senti-lo?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;O vistante desviou subitamente o olhar do lojista e concentrou-se na mulher que acompanhava. O lojista tamb&amp;eacute;m a fixou, cativado por uma qualquer atrac&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o irresist&amp;iacute;vel. Vou-a levantar a custo a cabe&amp;ccedil;a, o cabelo pastoso apartando-se ligeiramente, revelando um rosto assustador. A pele, de um branco marm&amp;oacute;reo, era oleosa e atravessada por veias como varizes, muito evidentes e muito azuis. Os olhos que o fitavam, apesar de negros e encovados, brilhavam intensamente e havia neles um ar de reconhecimento. O lojista largou a arma e abriu a boca para falar. A voz falhou-lhe. Aquela mulher, ele conhecia-a. Conhecia-a muito bem e h&amp;aacute; muito tempo. Mas nunca a tinha visto assim, naquele estado. Tinha dificuldade em crer nos pr&amp;oacute;prios olhos. Mas n&amp;atilde;o havia d&amp;uacute;vida, era ela.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;Acirc;ngela!&amp;rdquo;, exclamou por fim. Ela esbo&amp;ccedil;ou um sorriso que, revelando dentes amarelados e pontiagudos entre l&amp;aacute;bios finos e negros era mais assustador que amistoso, e respondeu numa voz &amp;aacute;spera e muito sumida.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ol&amp;aacute;, Pistolas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;",

A cidade estava a enlouquecer. Era muito estranha, muito estranha, a passividade de quem deveria estar a manter a ordem. Mas era ainda mais estranho que ninguém o tivesse vindo visitar à sua loja de banda desenhada e artigos festivos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;A cortina deteve-se com um estrondo e o som ecoou pelos corredores vazios, demorando a extinguir-se nas profundezas da galeria comercial mal iluminada que, hoje, cheirava pior que de costume.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Mas será, realmente? Assim tão estranho?”, pensou. Já não eram os anos oitenta. Olhou para baixo, para os pés. Antigamente tê-los-ia visto, mas agora eram escondidos pela camisola, inchada como um balão. Deu uma leve palmada no estômago e esboçou um esgar, que de sorriso tinha pouco. Como o tempo passava. Como os clichés se concretizavam. Abanou a cabeça.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Com o tilintar de chaves e um estalido, a fechadura ficou trancada. A cortina não subiria de novo até à tarde do dia seguinte. Disso o lojista tinha a certeza. Não parecia, mas era uma estrutura altamente reforçada.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contemplou a soma da sua vida. Tinha tomado conta da loja aos trinta anos, pensando tratar-se de um grande negócio. Sempre tinha gostado de banda desenhada, portanto que melhor ideia que fazer disso vida? Trabalharia ali sozinho para começar, depois empregaria ajudantes e finalmente expandiria para outros locais. Em menos de dez anos teria liberdade financeira e poderia dedicar-se aos seus outros interesses no abundante tempo livre. Se perguntassem ao lojista onde exactamente é que esse plano tinha corrido mal, ele não saberia dizer. Não havia um momento ao qual fosse óbvio apontar o dedo e dizer “foi aqui”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suspirou. Tudo que tinha havido era uma inocente sucessão de dias, todos iguais uns aos outros. Dias que, individualmente inofensivos, tinham-se acumulado rapidamente e, de alguma forma, resultado num grande e assustador monstro feito de tempo e desapontamento. O lojista tinha hoje quase sessenta anos. Sem filhos, e com plena consciência de que a loja na galeria moribunda estava a pouco tempo de desaparecer, não deixaria grande legado.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Olhou para a esquerda, por cima do ombro, na direcção de uma montra esparsamente povoada por caixas velhas de videojogos. Sim, o mundo tinha mudado muito. Já quase ninguém vinha à sua loja pela banda desenhada, pelas figuras articuladas ou pelos jogos de tabuleiro. O pouco que vendia era pela internet, e os magros lucros disso ainda tinham que ser partilhados com o rapaz que lhe tratava da página, ou site, ou lá como se chamava aquilo. Se não fosse pelos artigos festivos, particularmente os pirotécnicos, estaria a viver em Passos Manuel dentro de uma caixa de cartão.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Um passo ligeiro, denunciado pelo mais leve dos sons, arrancou-o da contemplação e atirou-o de volta à realidade. Tinha aprendido a estar atento, graças aos clientes que não lhe visitavam a loja pelos super heróis. Num piscar de olhos, levou a mão ao interior do sobretudo e soltou a mola do coldre que sempre o acompanhava. Agarrou a coronha e virou-se para a direita, de onde ouvira o passo. Deu com duas figuras de pé à sua frente, nem a três metros de distância. Um fedor a carne podre invadiu-lhe as narinas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sentiu os pêlos da nuca a eriçarem-se. Estava habituado a receber gente muito esquisita, mas estes dois pareciam saídos da selva. Roupas escuras todas rasgadas, manchadas de vermelho enferrujado, revelavam uma variedade de cortes, escoriações e feridas abertas. E aquele cheiro? Revoltava o estômago. Teve que fazer um grande esforço para não vomitar ali mesmo. Moveu os pés para manter o equilíbrio, vacilou e encostou-se à cortina de metal em busca de apoio. Olhou melhor para os seus inesperados visitantes, que não se mexiam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Um era moreno, de estatura média, e olhava-o com interesse. A outra, apoiada com evidente dificuldade no seu braço, era uma loira platinada cujo cabelo extremamente longo e sujo cobria o rosto. Os dedos finos e longos da sua mão direita eram brancos como giz e terminavam em unhas de um vermelho demasiado vivo. Tinha-as cravadas no braço do ajudante com o que parecia a última força que lhe restava. Como é que aqueles dois tinham conseguido aproximar-se dele sem fazer qualquer barulho, o lojista não percebia. Contudo, à excepção daquele último passo, permaneciam completamente silenciosos. E aquele cheiro, seria ele o único a senti-lo?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;O vistante desviou subitamente o olhar do lojista e concentrou-se na mulher que acompanhava. O lojista também a fixou, cativado por uma qualquer atracção irresistível. Vou-a levantar a custo a cabeça, o cabelo pastoso apartando-se ligeiramente, revelando um rosto assustador. A pele, de um branco marmóreo, era oleosa e atravessada por veias como varizes, muito evidentes e muito azuis. Os olhos que o fitavam, apesar de negros e encovados, brilhavam intensamente e havia neles um ar de reconhecimento. O lojista largou a arma e abriu a boca para falar. A voz falhou-lhe. Aquela mulher, ele conhecia-a. Conhecia-a muito bem e há muito tempo. Mas nunca a tinha visto assim, naquele estado. Tinha dificuldade em crer nos próprios olhos. Mas não havia dúvida, era ela.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ângela!”, exclamou por fim. Ela esboçou um sorriso que, revelando dentes amarelados e pontiagudos entre lábios finos e negros era mais assustador que amistoso, e respondeu numa voz áspera e muito sumida.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Olá, Pistolas.”&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

My mother was left to raise me and my yet to be born little sister. Things got difficult for her, barely earning a living as a high school teacher, and in 1984 my grandmother took us in. We meant to move out as soon as possible, but never did. The four of us would become something of a perfect family unit, unsoluble, held together by the unbreakable bonds of blood and love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;No one missed my father much. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;We would spend some time with him from time to time, my sister and I, but never grew any kind of affection for the man. I asked him to come back to our mother once, and don't really remember his answer. I only remember it didn't matter. We didn't really want his presence. He was a stranger and would remain one for the rest of his life. He was also, we would later learn, a drug addict.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I remember colour everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;My earliest memory is spilling a small drawer made of transparent plastic, full of tiny, multicolored glass beads, all over my sleeping parents. I must have been just over one at the time. We don't usually start keeping our memories until we're around three, but I kept that one. It was a lazy afternoon, probably Sunday. There was a warm yellow light coming from the windows. Sensations are imprinted in my memory much, much better than words. Mom and Dad woke up, quite startled, and that's where it gets fuzzy. I seem to remember laughter. There was never any shortage of that. I guess things were so difficult sometimes, we had to always be able to find something to laugh about. But anyway, the colours. And the sounds, and the smells, and the textures and the flavours. Between my mother's atelier, the quiet streets and gardens we played in and the rare visits to my father's workshop, my childhood was quite the feast to the senses. I'll never forget the smell of turpentine, or the taste of leather or the unique texture of fresh oil paint casually brushed on canvas. My senses drive me. I'm sure this is true for everybody else, I'm just maybe overly conscious of the fact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;My body wasn't quite on par with my mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;One morning, about a year before school, my left leg stopped working. I remember getting out of bed and just falling over. They diagnosed me with Perthe's disease and for two years my leg was encased in an unwieldy brace. I quickly learned how to run by skipping sideways and broke the braces some half a dozen times. School was awkward, though. Being the skinny kid with the cyborg leg had a huge impact on my social life. Not wanting to deal with all the questions and jokes, I became shy and reserved. I had a great time with the handful of kids who somehow befriended me, but shoved pretty much everyone else away. I also suffered from strong athsma attacks - which landed me in ER a few times. I wore glasses. And for about one year in middle school, I wet my bed. So yeah, weak, shy and prone to stop breathing. The one thing I had going for me was my indestructible skeleton - which was promptly put to good use when I learned to ride a bicycle. Also my banzai wrestling skills, completely out of character but invaluable at putting bullies in their place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Loved school, hated homework.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I loved learning but hated following orders. As of the time of this writing, this still hasn't changed. School was extremely easy. Grades were good and homework was avoided by working out which questions I'd be asked (factoring in the question number, my seating position and any missing classmates ) and doing only those, hastily, while my classmates answered theirs. I think that had a huge effect in building confidence in my ability to perform under pressure. The time I saved by not doing all the homework, I spent reading my mom's encyclopaedias, building my lego contraptions and taking my electronic toys apart. Also, riding my bike like a lunatic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;h4 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;1990s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I was always gazing at the stars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;For the longest time, it was one of my main hobbies. Everything about space fascinated me, from astronomy to science fiction. I read Sagan and Hawkings like the pages were cocaine. Astrophysicist sounded likej a really cool profession. I started writing science fiction, largely because what I read at the time didn't contain enough cool starfighter scenes. I think the writing was my first attempt at adding something to the world, at leaving my little impression on it. I wrote and I looked wistfully at the stars for a good long while.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I learned a lot from my parents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;My mother has always been a hard working woman, but never more so than during the 90s. Being the sole provider for the family, she piled freelancing gigs on top of an unreasonably busy highschool teacher schedule and still found the time and energy to throw her own painting exhibitions and take us all on vacation every year. While my father was a hedonistic failure of a person, my mother was an inspiring testiment to the power of gritty determination. Each in their own way, my parents taught me everything I needed to know about how to conduct myself as a person and, one day, a man. Yet I knew none of them could teach me about the path I wanted for myself - the path of the self made man. I like to say I discovered my ambitions one day when I asked Mom what profession she thought I should pursue. She replied that anything I wanted to do was fine, as long as I could provide for her in her old age. To this day she maintains it wasn't a reply meant to be taken literally, but it became one of my guiding principles in life. Having witnessed the harsh reality of a single person bringing up a whole family on a barely average salary, having felt so disappointed in my man-child of a father, a burning desire was ignited for something better. That's when I started looking more closely at the \"upper class\". It didn't take long for me to notice that the most well-to-do weren't teachers or doctors or engineers. They were businessmen. And that they rose from pretty much any walk of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Whatever I competed in, I won.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;School. Great grades. Soccer. My team always won - for a skinny kid, I put up one hell of a tackle. Lego races. Victory through superior technology - shock absorbers on downhill buggies, low CoG on track machines, low resistance skinny tyres on heavy, high inertia distance runners. Biking - going for the highest jumps, winning races against the older kids. Whatever the competition, losing would drive me mad. Quietly, efficiently, I always sought to find the position or the role in which my greatest advantaged laid, and press it. For me it was never about competing. It was about doing the things I loved and, if they were somehow competitive, winning at them. Usually by skill, sometimes by subtrefuge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;But then I came down with a bad case of adolescency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Though by the mid nineties I was a bright young boy who could do no wrong, around the time I turned 15 teenage angst and misguidedness hit me like a swift kick in the nuts. My worst flaws came to the fore. Grades plummeted. Hair grew to unreasonable lengths. And the worst thing is, in retrospect, it looks like I didn't really stop being a teenager until I was well into my twenties. The ten years from 1997 to 2007 were my own personal Dark Ages - in more ways than one. If a person is a kitchen, I was the one stocked with great gourmet ingredients yet staffed by the Swedish Chef.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;The only good things to come out of my late 90s were that we got a computer and I stumbled across HTML coding. That and the fact that, no matter how shitty things got in my head, I always managed to stay well clear of drugs and excessive driking. Maybe I was a bit boring - but I had good reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;h4 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;2000s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Dropped out of college and learned to code for the Web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Having gotten only average grades in highschool, a CS degree was out of reach and my applications were nearly all declined. I was stuck in a college I didn't like, taking a degree I didn't want just for the sake of going through college. By the end of the second semester at Electronic Engineering, of which I only attended the Computer Programming class (near perfect grades at that, by the way), I learned about a one year training program in Web Development. I dropped out of college and took that instead. Coding a static website for my highschool in '99 and a bunch of mIRC scripts in 2000 was nothing compared to the newly found awesomeness of PHP and ASP dynamic pages. I fell in love with the Web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Sadly, as you'll recall, Swedish Chef was still in charge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I jumped between lousy jobs like a flee between dying mongrels. With high expectations yet no confidence in the job market, I embarked upon an ill-advised entrepreneurial journey. First, selling websites to local car dealerships. It was the right idea - build a product once, sell it many times - but the market had already become saturated by low cost alternatives. When that well truly dried, I applied the same formula to real estate agencies - only to see the project die on the beach due to the mishaps of a co-founder who turned out to be a rotten piece of work. Then I built Deviant Art before it was time for Deviant Art and with the completely wrong business model. Then I tried my hand at a used car search engine, which was truly awesome yet totally bombed for a lack of promotion. It was failed project after failed project, mostly, I think, because I would never survive the crash after that initial period usually referred to as \"uninformed optimism\". I would think of something awesome, do it, then despair when the market showed indifference. And there was no one to talk to about my problems, because everyone around me was either unemployed - and therefore useless at giving career advice - or thought I should get a real job. Oh how I dreamed about having been raised in Silicon Valley instead. Or at the very least somewhere people wouldn't view aspiring entrepreneurs as complete retards. The whole thing did help me grow a thick skin and a strong sense of purpose, but in the end all I did was spin my wheels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Days turned into weeks, turned into months, turned into years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;You are what you eat. I would argue you're also who you surround yourself with. While I'm at it, I'd also argue there's something wrong with my generation - at least here in Europe. We're soft and devoid of drive. We drink and we smoke and we muddle through college on the way to dead end degrees we thought were okay to get because someone once promised \"you can do whatever makes you happy\" but never mentioned the caveats. I love my friends to death but many belong to this mass. They're 30 and they've failed at life so far and they're angry because The Man doesn't cuddle them like their parents did. They're mad because Life doesn't cut them a chance. They're mad but they're limp. Theirs isn't the kind of anger that drives and propels, it's the kind that corrodes and destroys. This wasn't the right kind of environment for someone who believes no one but himself can improve his lot in life and who wishes nothing but to create his own fortunes. But Swedish Chef's grip at my reigns was tight. I let myself drift down the current, deluded by \"projects\" which were nothing but placebos. Time, as it's prone to do, breezed past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;In late 2007, the stars aligned and I moved to Lisbon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Got a job. A really nice job. Started hanging out with people who actually had careers. Met the girl of my dreams. For a while, all was well. But, just like the Inquisition lingered on well after the Renaissance ended the Dark Ages, I still had one major screw-up left to do. Now, my reasons were entirely valid: I want to have my own business and an opportunity presented itself. Still, in retrospect, maybe I didn't absolutely have to quit my job. Maybe I should have waited until there was more of a money cushion in the bank. Things went wrong. I got a lot of clients (or pre-orders, rather) but didn't have the software ready. The partnerships on which my development depended slowly broke off, because those partners weren't really convinced of the benefit to them. I had designed Something People Want, only not quite been able to get it ready. Vapourware, in a way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I crashed and burned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Moved back to my Mom's old atelier and left the relationship with Dream Girl hanging by a thread. A state of near-as-makes-no-difference depression crept in. My old friends no longer saw me as much of an example. I had debts. It was a slow burning nightmare. Then I almost accepted a job in London. Saying no to that was hard, but it was also an important thing to do. It boosted my confidence. With my family's backing, I took a month to develop and market a yelp-like website. I launched it to some success. There were businesses ringing in, wanting to advertise. It was taking shape nicely. Then my old boss rang, offering me my job back, with a bit of a raise on top too. Despite the initial success, my little yelp clone would probably take more than a year to get to the point where it would earn me a decent living - Portugal; small market. So I took the job and went back to Lisbon. When the Throughs of Sorrow came for my site, I was intoxicated by the niceties of a stable life with a nice stable income and I didn't care. I let the project fade and die and, for a good long while, poured all of my energies into my regular job. It wasn't very entrepreneurial of me, but it was the sensible thing to do at the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I eventually discovered the allure of SaaS: enter Threddie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;In June 2010 I watched the video of a great talk by David Heinemeier Hanson on building profitable businesses online. He drove home the point that you don't really need to swing for the fences if your goal is simply to become a millionaire: 2000 users at 40$ a month each will get you there in a year (sort of). His talk stroke a chord with me and building SaaS started looking like a very viable route to achieving my goals. So in August 2010 I launched a web app and it became one of the most fascinating and rewarding experiences of my career as a web developer to date. It was a simple post-and-comment system billed as a \"simplified brainstorming\" tool. Threddie got great reviews, attracted a bunch of users and helped me learn the ropes of actual web app marketing, building relationships with bloggers and customers. I never pushed it to TechCrunch, Mashable or the other heavy hitters, but SmashingMagazine did throw a completely unsolicited nod in my direction once. I even had people sign up as customers, though in the single digits. For the first time ever, I had a product that I could sell without any overhead at all and therefore a scalable business model. But there was still a lot of work to do both in terms of the product and in its marketing, and I was still completely dedicated to my job. So Threddie never got the attention it needed to really mature and bloom, but as an experience it was great.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;The world economic crysis descended upon Portugal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;We were working more than ever but posting negative results anyway. Clients were buying less, smaller campaigns no matter what we did. Management in Madrid didn't care about the ideas and the technologies we were proposing to address the problems - and boy, did I burn the midnight oil coming up with some of that stuff. Results continued to plummet and eventually everyone but the manager and a junior salesperson were laid off in Q1 2011.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Sorrow and perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;The lay-off and ensuing severance package turned out to be a boon in disguise because they gave me the freedom to join the rest of my family during my grandmother's final days. She was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer in March and passed away in late April. It's too soon to write in detail about those two months. Suffice to say that I saw her as another Mother, grieved accordingly and won't ever really stop feeling her absence. But her passing, and my looming 30th birthday, did help stoke the fires of entrepreneurship. Motivated by the cruel reminders of the passage of time, freed from the numbing comfort of a good day job, my return to the land of the living was incisive and determined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Which brings me to today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I'm an independent web developer again. This time there's nowhere to run to if things go sour, which only fuels my drive to succeed. I'm a much better coder and getting better every day. Plus, at 29, I'm young enough to be down with the latest trends yet old enough to be taken seriously. At the same time, I'm working on Threddie on nights and weekends. I look at giants like yammer and then I look at my own work and I think I'm on to something. Maybe even swing-for-the-fences material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I'm just missing a network of peers. Successful entrepreneurs in Portugal are rare and aloof. Reaching out to the stars of Sillicon Valley is hard because I haven't yet given them reason to take notice. I may need to take a little hop across the Pond one of these days&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

My mother was left to raise me and my yet to be born little sister. Things got difficult for her, barely earning a living as a high school teacher, and in 1984 my grandmother took us in. We meant to move out as soon as possible, but never did. The four of us would become something of a perfect family unit, unsoluble, held together by the unbreakable bonds of blood and love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;No one missed my father much. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;We would spend some time with him from time to time, my sister and I, but never grew any kind of affection for the man. I asked him to come back to our mother once, and don't really remember his answer. I only remember it didn't matter. We didn't really want his presence. He was a stranger and would remain one for the rest of his life. He was also, we would later learn, a drug addict.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I remember colour everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;My earliest memory is spilling a small drawer made of transparent plastic, full of tiny, multicolored glass beads, all over my sleeping parents. I must have been just over one at the time. We don't usually start keeping our memories until we're around three, but I kept that one. It was a lazy afternoon, probably Sunday. There was a warm yellow light coming from the windows. Sensations are imprinted in my memory much, much better than words. Mom and Dad woke up, quite startled, and that's where it gets fuzzy. I seem to remember laughter. There was never any shortage of that. I guess things were so difficult sometimes, we had to always be able to find something to laugh about. But anyway, the colours. And the sounds, and the smells, and the textures and the flavours. Between my mother's atelier, the quiet streets and gardens we played in and the rare visits to my father's workshop, my childhood was quite the feast to the senses. I'll never forget the smell of turpentine, or the taste of leather or the unique texture of fresh oil paint casually brushed on canvas. My senses drive me. I'm sure this is true for everybody else, I'm just maybe overly conscious of the fact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;My body wasn't quite on par with my mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;One morning, about a year before school, my left leg stopped working. I remember getting out of bed and just falling over. They diagnosed me with Perthe's disease and for two years my leg was encased in an unwieldy brace. I quickly learned how to run by skipping sideways and broke the braces some half a dozen times. School was awkward, though. Being the skinny kid with the cyborg leg had a huge impact on my social life. Not wanting to deal with all the questions and jokes, I became shy and reserved. I had a great time with the handful of kids who somehow befriended me, but shoved pretty much everyone else away. I also suffered from strong athsma attacks - which landed me in ER a few times. I wore glasses. And for about one year in middle school, I wet my bed. So yeah, weak, shy and prone to stop breathing. The one thing I had going for me was my indestructible skeleton - which was promptly put to good use when I learned to ride a bicycle. Also my banzai wrestling skills, completely out of character but invaluable at putting bullies in their place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Loved school, hated homework.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I loved learning but hated following orders. As of the time of this writing, this still hasn't changed. School was extremely easy. Grades were good and homework was avoided by working out which questions I'd be asked (factoring in the question number, my seating position and any missing classmates ) and doing only those, hastily, while my classmates answered theirs. I think that had a huge effect in building confidence in my ability to perform under pressure. The time I saved by not doing all the homework, I spent reading my mom's encyclopaedias, building my lego contraptions and taking my electronic toys apart. Also, riding my bike like a lunatic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;h4 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;1990s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I was always gazing at the stars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;For the longest time, it was one of my main hobbies. Everything about space fascinated me, from astronomy to science fiction. I read Sagan and Hawkings like the pages were cocaine. Astrophysicist sounded likej a really cool profession. I started writing science fiction, largely because what I read at the time didn't contain enough cool starfighter scenes. I think the writing was my first attempt at adding something to the world, at leaving my little impression on it. I wrote and I looked wistfully at the stars for a good long while.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I learned a lot from my parents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;My mother has always been a hard working woman, but never more so than during the 90s. Being the sole provider for the family, she piled freelancing gigs on top of an unreasonably busy highschool teacher schedule and still found the time and energy to throw her own painting exhibitions and take us all on vacation every year. While my father was a hedonistic failure of a person, my mother was an inspiring testiment to the power of gritty determination. Each in their own way, my parents taught me everything I needed to know about how to conduct myself as a person and, one day, a man. Yet I knew none of them could teach me about the path I wanted for myself - the path of the self made man. I like to say I discovered my ambitions one day when I asked Mom what profession she thought I should pursue. She replied that anything I wanted to do was fine, as long as I could provide for her in her old age. To this day she maintains it wasn't a reply meant to be taken literally, but it became one of my guiding principles in life. Having witnessed the harsh reality of a single person bringing up a whole family on a barely average salary, having felt so disappointed in my man-child of a father, a burning desire was ignited for something better. That's when I started looking more closely at the \"upper class\". It didn't take long for me to notice that the most well-to-do weren't teachers or doctors or engineers. They were businessmen. And that they rose from pretty much any walk of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Whatever I competed in, I won.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;School.

Biking - going for the highest jumps, winning races against the older kids. Whatever the competition, losing would drive me mad. Quietly, efficiently, I always sought to find the position or the role in which my greatest advantaged laid, and press it. For me it was never about competing. It was about doing the things I loved and, if they were somehow competitive, winning at them. Usually by skill, sometimes by subtrefuge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;But then I came down with a bad case of adolescency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Though by the mid nineties I was a bright young boy who could do no wrong, around the time I turned 15 teenage angst and misguidedness hit me like a swift kick in the nuts. My worst flaws came to the fore. Grades plummeted. Hair grew to unreasonable lengths. And the worst thing is, in retrospect, it looks like I didn't really stop being a teenager until I was well into my twenties. The ten years from 1997 to 2007 were my own personal Dark Ages - in more ways than one. If a person is a kitchen, I was the one stocked with great gourmet ingredients yet staffed by the Swedish Chef.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;The only good things to come out of my late 90s were that we got a computer and I stumbled across HTML coding. That and the fact that, no matter how shitty things got in my head, I always managed to stay well clear of drugs and excessive driking. Maybe I was a bit boring - but I had good reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;h4 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;2000s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Dropped out of college and learned to code for the Web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Having gotten only average grades in highschool, a CS degree was out of reach and my applications were nearly all declined. I was stuck in a college I didn't like, taking a degree I didn't want just for the sake of going through college. By the end of the second semester at Electronic Engineering, of which I only attended the Computer Programming class (near perfect grades at that, by the way), I learned about a one year training program in Web Development. I dropped out of college and took that instead. Coding a static website for my highschool in '99 and a bunch of mIRC scripts in 2000 was nothing compared to the newly found awesomeness of PHP and ASP dynamic pages. I fell in love with the Web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Sadly, as you'll recall, Swedish Chef was still in charge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I jumped between lousy jobs like a flee between dying mongrels. With high expectations yet no confidence in the job market, I embarked upon an ill-advised entrepreneurial journey. First, selling websites to local car dealerships. It was the right idea - build a product once, sell it many times - but the market had already become saturated by low cost alternatives. When that well truly dried, I applied the same formula to real estate agencies - only to see the project die on the beach due to the mishaps of a co-founder who turned out to be a rotten piece of work. Then I built Deviant Art before it was time for Deviant Art and with the completely wrong business model. Then I tried my hand at a used car search engine, which was truly awesome yet totally bombed for a lack of promotion. It was failed project after failed project, mostly, I think, because I would never survive the crash after that initial period usually referred to as \"uninformed optimism\". I would think of something awesome, do it, then despair when the market showed indifference. And there was no one to talk to about my problems, because everyone around me was either unemployed - and therefore useless at giving career advice - or thought I should get a real job. Oh how I dreamed about having been raised in Silicon Valley instead. Or at the very least somewhere people wouldn't view aspiring entrepreneurs as complete retards. The whole thing did help me grow a thick skin and a strong sense of purpose, but in the end all I did was spin my wheels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Days turned into weeks, turned into months, turned into years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;You are what you eat. I would argue you're also who you surround yourself with. While I'm at it, I'd also argue there's something wrong with my generation - at least here in Europe. We're soft and devoid of drive. We drink and we smoke and we muddle through college on the way to dead end degrees we thought were okay to get because someone once promised \"you can do whatever makes you happy\" but never mentioned the caveats. I love my friends to death but many belong to this mass. They're 30 and they've failed at life so far and they're angry because The Man doesn't cuddle them like their parents did. They're mad because Life doesn't cut them a chance. They're mad but they're limp. Theirs isn't the kind of anger that drives and propels, it's the kind that corrodes and destroys. This wasn't the right kind of environment for someone who believes no one but himself can improve his lot in life and who wishes nothing but to create his own fortunes. But Swedish Chef's grip at my reigns was tight. I let myself drift down the current, deluded by \"projects\" which were nothing but placebos. Time, as it's prone to do, breezed past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;In late 2007, the stars aligned and I moved to Lisbon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Got a job. A really nice job. Started hanging out with people who actually had careers. Met the girl of my dreams. For a while, all was well. But, just like the Inquisition lingered on well after the Renaissance ended the Dark Ages, I still had one major screw-up left to do. Now, my reasons were entirely valid: I want to have my own business and an opportunity presented itself. Still, in retrospect, maybe I didn't absolutely have to quit my job. Maybe I should have waited until there was more of a money cushion in the bank. Things went wrong. I got a lot of clients (or pre-orders, rather) but didn't have the software ready. The partnerships on which my development depended slowly broke off, because those partners weren't really convinced of the benefit to them. I had designed Something People Want, only not quite been able to get it ready. Vapourware, in a way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I crashed and burned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Moved back to my Mom's old atelier and left the relationship with Dream Girl hanging by a thread. A state of near-as-makes-no-difference depression crept in. My old friends no longer saw me as much of an example. I had debts. It was a slow burning nightmare. Then I almost accepted a job in London. Saying no to that was hard, but it was also an important thing to do. It boosted my confidence. With my family's backing, I took a month to develop and market a yelp-like website. I launched it to some success. There were businesses ringing in, wanting to advertise. It was taking shape nicely. Then my old boss rang, offering me my job back, with a bit of a raise on top too. Despite the initial success, my little yelp clone would probably take more than a year to get to the point where it would earn me a decent living - Portugal; small market. So I took the job and went back to Lisbon. When the Throughs of Sorrow came for my site, I was intoxicated by the niceties of a stable life with a nice stable income and I didn't care. I let the project fade and die and, for a good long while, poured all of my energies into my regular job. It wasn't very entrepreneurial of me, but it was the sensible thing to do at the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I eventually discovered the allure of SaaS: enter Threddie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;In June 2010 I watched the video of a great talk by David Heinemeier Hanson on building profitable businesses online. He drove home the point that you don't really need to swing for the fences if your goal is simply to become a millionaire: 2000 users at 40$ a month each will get you there in a year (sort of). His talk stroke a chord with me and building SaaS started looking like a very viable route to achieving my goals. So in August 2010 I launched a web app and it became one of the most fascinating and rewarding experiences of my career as a web developer to date. It was a simple post-and-comment system billed as a \"simplified brainstorming\" tool. Threddie got great reviews, attracted a bunch of users and helped me learn the ropes of actual web app marketing, building relationships with bloggers and customers. I never pushed it to TechCrunch, Mashable or the other heavy hitters, but SmashingMagazine did throw a completely unsolicited nod in my direction once. I even had people sign up as customers, though in the single digits. For the first time ever, I had a product that I could sell without any overhead at all and therefore a scalable business model. But there was still a lot of work to do both in terms of the product and in its marketing, and I was still completely dedicated to my job. So Threddie never got the attention it needed to really mature and bloom, but as an experience it was great.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;The world economic crysis descended upon Portugal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;We were working more than ever but posting negative results anyway. Clients were buying less, smaller campaigns no matter what we did. Management in Madrid didn't care about the ideas and the technologies we were proposing to address the problems - and boy, did I burn the midnight oil coming up with some of that stuff. Results continued to plummet and eventually everyone but the manager and a junior salesperson were laid off in Q1 2011.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Sorrow and perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;The lay-off and ensuing severance package turned out to be a boon in disguise because they gave me the freedom to join the rest of my family during my grandmother's final days. She was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer in March and passed away in late April. It's too soon to write in detail about those two months. Suffice to say that I saw her as another Mother, grieved accordingly and won't ever really stop feeling her absence. But her passing, and my looming 30th birthday, did help stoke the fires of entrepreneurship. Motivated by the cruel reminders of the passage of time, freed from the numbing comfort of a good day job, my return to the land of the living was incisive and determined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;h5 style=\"font-family: Times;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Which brings me to today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I'm an independent web developer again. This time there's nowhere to run to if things go sour, which only fuels my drive to succeed. I'm a much better coder and getting better every day. Plus, at 29, I'm young enough to be down with the latest trends yet old enough to be taken seriously. At the same time, I'm working on Threddie on nights and weekends. I look at giants like yammer and then I look at my own work and I think I'm on to something. Maybe even swing-for-the-fences material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I'm just missing a network of peers. Successful entrepreneurs in Portugal are rare and aloof. Reaching out to the stars of Sillicon Valley is hard because I haven't yet given them reason to take notice. I may need to take a little hop across the Pond one of these days&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

My mother was left to raise me and my yet to be born little sister. Things got difficult for her, barely earning a living as a high school teacher, and in 1984 my grandmother took us in. We meant to move out as soon as possible, but never did. The four of us would become something of a perfect family unit, unsoluble, held together by the unbreakable bonds of blood and love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;No one missed my father much. &lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;We would spend some time with him from time to time, my sister and I, but never grew any kind of affection for the man. I asked him to come back to our mother once, and don't really remember his answer. I only remember it didn't matter. We didn't really want his presence. He was a stranger and would remain one for the rest of his life. He was also, we would later learn, a drug addict.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;I remember colour everywhere.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;My earliest memory is spilling a small drawer made of transparent plastic, full of tiny, multicolored glass beads, all over my sleeping parents. I must have been just over one at the time. We don't usually start keeping our memories until we're around three, but I kept that one. It was a lazy afternoon, probably Sunday. There was a warm yellow light coming from the windows. Sensations are imprinted in my memory much, much better than words. Mom and Dad woke up, quite startled, and that's where it gets fuzzy. I seem to remember laughter. There was never any shortage of that. I guess things were so difficult sometimes, we had to always be able to find something to laugh about. But anyway, the colours. And the sounds, and the smells, and the textures and the flavours. Between my mother's atelier, the quiet streets and gardens we played in and the rare visits to my father's workshop, my childhood was quite the feast to the senses. I'll never forget the smell of turpentine, or the taste of leather or the unique texture of fresh oil paint casually brushed on canvas. My senses drive me. I'm sure this is true for everybody else, I'm just maybe overly conscious of the fact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;My body wasn't quite on par with my mind.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;One morning, about a year before school, my left leg stopped working. I remember getting out of bed and just falling over. They diagnosed me with Perthe's disease and for two years my leg was encased in an unwieldy brace. I quickly learned how to run by skipping sideways and broke the braces some half a dozen times. School was awkward, though. Being the skinny kid with the cyborg leg had a huge impact on my social life. Not wanting to deal with all the questions and jokes, I became shy and reserved. I had a great time with the handful of kids who somehow befriended me, but shoved pretty much everyone else away. I also suffered from strong athsma attacks - which landed me in ER a few times. I wore glasses. And for about one year in middle school, I wet my bed. So yeah, weak, shy and prone to stop breathing. The one thing I had going for me was my indestructible skeleton - which was promptly put to good use when I learned to ride a bicycle. Also my banzai wrestling skills, completely out of character but invaluable at putting bullies in their place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;Loved school, hated homework.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;I loved learning but hated following orders. As of the time of this writing, this still hasn't changed. School was extremely easy. Grades were good and homework was avoided by working out which questions I'd be asked (factoring in the question number, my seating position and any missing classmates ) and doing only those, hastily, while my classmates answered theirs. I think that had a huge effect in building confidence in my ability to perform under pressure. The time I saved by not doing all the homework, I spent reading my mom's encyclopaedias, building my lego contraptions and taking my electronic toys apart. Also, riding my bike like a lunatic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;1990s &lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;I was always gazing at the stars.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;For the longest time, it was one of my main hobbies. Everything about space fascinated me, from astronomy to science fiction. I read Sagan and Hawkings like the pages were cocaine. Astrophysicist sounded likej a really cool profession. I started writing science fiction, largely because what I read at the time didn't contain enough cool starfighter scenes. I think the writing was my first attempt at adding something to the world, at leaving my little impression on it. I wrote and I looked wistfully at the stars for a good long while.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;I learned a lot from my parents.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;My mother has always been a hard working woman, but never more so than during the 90s. Being the sole provider for the family, she piled freelancing gigs on top of an unreasonably busy highschool teacher schedule and still found the time and energy to throw her own painting exhibitions and take us all on vacation every year. While my father was a hedonistic failure of a person, my mother was an inspiring testiment to the power of gritty determination. Each in their own way, my parents taught me everything I needed to know about how to conduct myself as a person and, one day, a man. Yet I knew none of them could teach me about the path I wanted for myself - the path of the self made man. I like to say I discovered my ambitions one day when I asked Mom what profession she thought I should pursue. She replied that anything I wanted to do was fine, as long as I could provide for her in her old age. To this day she maintains it wasn't a reply meant to be taken literally, but it became one of my guiding principles in life. Having witnessed the harsh reality of a single person bringing up a whole family on a barely average salary, having felt so disappointed in my man-child of a father, a burning desire was ignited for something better. That's when I started looking more closely at the \"upper class\". It didn't take long for me to notice that the most well-to-do weren't teachers or doctors or engineers. They were businessmen. And that they rose from pretty much any walk of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;Whatever I competed in, I won.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;School. Great grades. Soccer. My team always won - for a skinny kid, I put up one hell of a tackle. Lego races. Victory through superior technology - shock absorbers on downhill buggies, low CoG on track machines, low resistance skinny tyres on heavy, high inertia distance runners. Biking - going for the highest jumps, winning races against the older kids. Whatever the competition, losing would drive me mad. Quietly, efficiently, I always sought to find the position or the role in which my greatest advantaged laid, and press it. For me it was never about competing. It was about doing the things I loved and, if they were somehow competitive, winning at them. Usually by skill, sometimes by subtrefuge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;But then I came down with a bad case of adolescency.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;Though by the mid nineties I was a bright young boy who could do no wrong, around the time I turned 15 teenage angst and misguidedness hit me like a swift kick in the nuts. My worst flaws came to the fore. Grades plummeted. Hair grew to unreasonable lengths. And the worst thing is, in retrospect, it looks like I didn't really stop being a teenager until I was well into my twenties. The ten years from 1997 to 2007 were my own personal Dark Ages - in more ways than one. If a person is a kitchen, I was the one stocked with great gourmet ingredients yet staffed by the Swedish Chef.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The only good things to come out of my late 90s were that we got a computer and I stumbled across HTML coding. That and the fact that, no matter how shitty things got in my head, I always managed to stay well clear of drugs and excessive driking. Maybe I was a bit boring - but I had good reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;2000s&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;Dropped out of college and learned to code for the Web.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;Having gotten only average grades in highschool, a CS degree was out of reach and my applications were nearly all declined. I was stuck in a college I didn't like, taking a degree I didn't want just for the sake of going through college. By the end of the second semester at Electronic Engineering, of which I only attended the Computer Programming class (near perfect grades at that, by the way), I learned about a one year training program in Web Development.

I fell in love with the Web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;Sadly, as you'll recall, Swedish Chef was still in charge.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;I jumped between lousy jobs like a flee between dying mongrels. With high expectations yet no confidence in the job market, I embarked upon an ill-advised entrepreneurial journey. First, selling websites to local car dealerships. It was the right idea - build a product once, sell it many times - but the market had already become saturated by low cost alternatives. When that well truly dried, I applied the same formula to real estate agencies - only to see the project die on the beach due to the mishaps of a co-founder who turned out to be a rotten piece of work. Then I built Deviant Art before it was time for Deviant Art and with the completely wrong business model. Then I tried my hand at a used car search engine, which was truly awesome yet totally bombed for a lack of promotion. It was failed project after failed project, mostly, I think, because I would never survive the crash after that initial period usually referred to as \"uninformed optimism\". I would think of something awesome, do it, then despair when the market showed indifference. And there was no one to talk to about my problems, because everyone around me was either unemployed - and therefore useless at giving career advice - or thought I should get a real job. Oh how I dreamed about having been raised in Silicon Valley instead. Or at the very least somewhere people wouldn't view aspiring entrepreneurs as complete retards. The whole thing did help me grow a thick skin and a strong sense of purpose, but in the end all I did was spin my wheels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;Days turned into weeks, turned into months, turned into years.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;You are what you eat. I would argue you're also who you surround yourself with. While I'm at it, I'd also argue there's something wrong with my generation - at least here in Europe. We're soft and devoid of drive. We drink and we smoke and we muddle through college on the way to dead end degrees we thought were okay to get because someone once promised \"you can do whatever makes you happy\" but never mentioned the caveats. I love my friends to death but many belong to this mass. They're 30 and they've failed at life so far and they're angry because The Man doesn't cuddle them like their parents did. They're mad because Life doesn't cut them a chance. They're mad but they're limp. Theirs isn't the kind of anger that drives and propels, it's the kind that corrodes and destroys. This wasn't the right kind of environment for someone who believes no one but himself can improve his lot in life and who wishes nothing but to create his own fortunes. But Swedish Chef's grip at my reigns was tight. I let myself drift down the current, deluded by \"projects\" which were nothing but placebos. Time, as it's prone to do, breezed past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;In late 2007, the stars aligned and I moved to Lisbon.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;Got a job. A really nice job. Started hanging out with people who actually had careers. Met the girl of my dreams. For a while, all was well. But, just like the Inquisition lingered on well after the Renaissance ended the Dark Ages, I still had one major screw-up left to do. Now, my reasons were entirely valid: I want to have my own business and an opportunity presented itself. Still, in retrospect, maybe I didn't absolutely have to quit my job. Maybe I should have waited until there was more of a money cushion in the bank. Things went wrong. I got a lot of clients (or pre-orders, rather) but didn't have the software ready. The partnerships on which my development depended slowly broke off, because those partners weren't really convinced of the benefit to them. I had designed Something People Want, only not quite been able to get it ready. Vapourware, in a way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;I crashed and burned.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;Moved back to my Mom's old atelier and left the relationship with Dream Girl hanging by a thread. A state of near-as-makes-no-difference depression crept in. My old friends no longer saw me as much of an example. I had debts. It was a slow burning nightmare. Then I almost accepted a job in London. Saying no to that was hard, but it was also an important thing to do. It boosted my confidence. With my family's backing, I took a month to develop and market a yelp-like website. I launched it to some success. There were businesses ringing in, wanting to advertise. It was taking shape nicely. Then my old boss rang, offering me my job back, with a bit of a raise on top too. Despite the initial success, my little yelp clone would probably take more than a year to get to the point where it would earn me a decent living - Portugal; small market. So I took the job and went back to Lisbon. When the Throughs of Sorrow came for my site, I was intoxicated by the niceties of a stable life with a nice stable income and I didn't care. I let the project fade and die and, for a good long while, poured all of my energies into my regular job. It wasn't very entrepreneurial of me, but it was the sensible thing to do at the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;I eventually discovered the allure of SaaS: enter Threddie.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;In June 2010 I watched the video of a great talk by David Heinemeier Hanson on building profitable businesses online. He drove home the point that you don't really need to swing for the fences if your goal is simply to become a millionaire: 2000 users at 40$ a month each will get you there in a year (sort of). His talk stroke a chord with me and building SaaS started looking like a very viable route to achieving my goals. So in August 2010 I launched a web app and it became one of the most fascinating and rewarding experiences of my career as a web developer to date. It was a simple post-and-comment system billed as a \"simplified brainstorming\" tool. Threddie got great reviews, attracted a bunch of users and helped me learn the ropes of actual web app marketing, building relationships with bloggers and customers. I never pushed it to TechCrunch, Mashable or the other heavy hitters, but SmashingMagazine did throw a completely unsolicited nod in my direction once. I even had people sign up as customers, though in the single digits. For the first time ever, I had a product that I could sell without any overhead at all and therefore a scalable business model. But there was still a lot of work to do both in terms of the product and in its marketing, and I was still completely dedicated to my job. So Threddie never got the attention it needed to really mature and bloom, but as an experience it was great.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;The world economic crysis descended upon Portugal.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;We were working more than ever but posting negative results anyway. Clients were buying less, smaller campaigns no matter what we did. Management in Madrid didn't care about the ideas and the technologies we were proposing to address the problems - and boy, did I burn the midnight oil coming up with some of that stuff. Results continued to plummet and eventually everyone but the manager and a junior salesperson were laid off in Q1 2011.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;Sorrow and perspective.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;The lay-off and ensuing severance package turned out to be a boon in disguise because they gave me the freedom to join the rest of my family during my grandmother's final days. She was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer in March and passed away in late April. It's too soon to write in detail about those two months. Suffice to say that I saw her as another Mother, grieved accordingly and won't ever really stop feeling her absence. But her passing, and my looming 30th birthday, did help stoke the fires of entrepreneurship. Motivated by the cruel reminders of the passage of time, freed from the numbing comfort of a good day job, my return to the land of the living was incisive and determined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;Which brings me to today.&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;span&gt;I'm an independent web developer again. This time there's nowhere to run to if things go sour, which only fuels my drive to succeed. I'm a much better coder and getting better every day. Plus, at 29, I'm young enough to be down with the latest trends yet old enough to be taken seriously. At the same time, I'm working on Threddie on nights and weekends. I look at giants like yammer and then I look at my own work and I think I'm on to something. Maybe even swing-for-the-fences material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;I'm just missing a network of peers. Successful entrepreneurs in Portugal are rare and aloof. Reaching out to the stars of Sillicon Valley is hard because I haven't yet given them reason to take notice. I may need to take a little hop across the Pond one of these days…&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

You&amp;#39;ll see a panel with six main areas (Domain Information, Domain Enhancements, Related Products, Nameservers, DNS Manager and TLD Specific).

Just enter your subdomain name there and nothing else. Then enter the different server&amp;#39;s IP address and save everything.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sit tight for an hour of so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try to access your subdomain on a browser. It should be going through. If it isn&amp;#39;t, don&amp;#39;t panic, just wait a little longer. Whatever you do, don&amp;#39;t start messing around with the DNS settings. Propagation takes time.

I have no boss, call my own shots and set my own schedule.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;But it also sucks. I hate being alone all day, stuck at home with no one to talk to but people on the interwebs.&amp;nbsp;This is of course a very well known problem with &lt;em&gt;freelancerdom&lt;/em&gt;, felt by those on all walks of freelancing life. It's seen its fair share of discussion &lt;a href=\"http://gettingink.typepad.com/getting_ink/2008/08/10-reasons-bein.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, but it's one thing to read about it and quite another to experience its harsh reality.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;I have, of course, had a previous experience as a freelancer of sorts, back when I lived in Oporto. But here in Lisbon it's different. I don't have quite the same network of friends and clients with whom to get my socializin' on, so for most of the day it's just me, my mac and my cats. So when my girlfriend gets home she's like \"how was your day\" and I'm like \"meh\".&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;I've known since I first laid hands on a laptop that my best possible work environment if a coffee shop. I've spent the last three years actively trying to find out &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. Which is harder than it seems, because I tend to get so carried away with all this &lt;em&gt;being myself&lt;/em&gt; that I forget to do any significant &lt;em&gt;observations&lt;/em&gt; on my own behaviour. I guess this is why time, exercise and expense trackers are so popular. It takes an objective third party for a human being to be able to accurately measure his or her own behaviour.

I was pushing ahead with &lt;a href=\"http://threddie.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;Threddie&lt;/a&gt; in my free time, but it was nowhere near the point of bringing in enough revenue to be considered a serious occupation. I was spinning too many plates and felt a bit overwhelmed.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Then my employer laid almost everyone off.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I went on some kind of instinctive spirit walk, and my identity as a developer started to seem more important than ever. There's enough material here for an entire series of posts, but suffice to say I started paying a lot more attention to my tools and my skills. Upgraded my gear, read some books...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Fast forward to today:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shiny new 13\" macbook pro.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Switched to a lightweight TextWrangler/vim/&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;workflow.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Relying on a thin &lt;a href=\"http://www.moleskine.com/catalogue/classic/cahier/cardboard_kraft_cover/set_of_3_plain_cahier_journals__kraft__large.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;moleskine cahier&lt;/a&gt; for each project's sketches and notes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Started making my shit available on &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/pgscandeias\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I truly believe one's tools have a direct impact on the quality of one's work, so there's a lot to be said about that. But &lt;b&gt;the bit about github is what really matters&lt;/b&gt; here. That's a place where developers post their code for the whole world to see. It's filled with the best and brightest, which makes it a bit intimidating, but I'm finally stepping up and joining them. Some of my stuff if now open source, and I plan to keep uploading stuff. Maybe even fork someone other people's projects sometime.&nbsp;I'm insanely confident in my work now.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\nWhen people ask me what I do, there's no longer any doubt.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;I'm a programmer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So for the first time in years, I finally have some peace of mind.&lt;/div&gt;",

Location is king.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Here in Portugal, I can't find a real estate search engine that gives me a house's exact location. I'm not sure why. Maybe realtors prefer it if people are forced to enquire about a house before learning its exact location, so the realtor gets a change to persuade the punter. Perhaps it's an effort to mask undesirable locations. Whatever the reason, it's dated. People have come to expect complete information on whatever they're interested in to be readily available online, so it's only a matter of time before all real estate listings emulate Redfin and start disclosing full geolocation data.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;2. Smartphones are here (and have been for a while).&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;Why can't I use my iphone to run a quick search which automatically centers on my current location and displays results on a map?

There's no reason at all for this to be the case, especially in a country where iphones and androids sell like hot cookies.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;As ever, the challenge lies not in the technology but in the marketing. With no API to readily consume, I'll be forced to recruit realtors one by one in order to build enough of a database for the website to be worth the visitors' time. Ideally, I'd get a few nation-wide real estate agencies to list their inventory with me - and then snowball from there. But that could prove tricky, since I'm only just starting out and have no traffic to show.

It&amp;#39;s a real estate listing application with a heavy focus on geolocation, which I&amp;#39;m building mainly for fun (and hopefully some profit).&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I should mention I&amp;#39;m quite the perfectionist and a bit of a control freak, and always liked starting things from scratch. I&amp;#39;ve heard all the arguments in favor of using well established frameworks for web development yet none stuck. Although I&amp;#39;ll do it professionally, I prefer not to touch other people&amp;#39;s code other than the odd snippet or tutorial when I&amp;#39;m working for myself.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;So it shouldn&amp;#39;t come as a surprise that, when starting this real estate side project, I found myself needing to code a lot of low level stuff anew. Sure, I was reusing the core of my homebrewed MVC libraries, but because there was some new stuff I wanted to try with the routing and the user authentication and so on, much of the implementation was unique.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, the early stages of a project are always times of unbridled optimist and inspiration. But a lot of it is wasted while coding the foundations. Even trying out that cool new HTTP Auth trick ends up getting boring after a while, for the simple reason that it&amp;#39;s got nothing to do with the project&amp;#39;s exciting main idea. Which is why lots of really smart people employ mainstream frameworks and/or boilerplate code, in order to get up and running before enthusiasm has a chance to fade. Since I really wanted to develop those boring parts myself, I had a problem.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The night before work on the project was scheduled to start, I went for a drink at my favourite bar and took the laptop along. It was a quiet tuesday night at Pinguim and I meant to try and get some work done in advance.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;After sitting at the counter for a while, my good friend the barista suggested I just lay the laptop right there instead of moving to a proper table. Seeing how tall the counter was in relation to the stool I sat upon, the idea was quickly dismissed on ergonomic grounds. However, something else occured to me.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was well aware of the stand-up, a special kind of meeting utilized in agile development processes like scrum. It&amp;#39;s timeboxed and help standing up, forcing participants to keep the meeting short and get to the point. The counter, too high to work on while sitting down, was perfectly positioned while standing up. So, I figured, why not try some stand-up programming? So I did. The rules were simple: don&amp;#39;t sit down until:&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. The app is able to CRUD users and real estate properties;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. User authentication is handled securely;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. There&amp;#39;s a template engine working;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4. I have something that works and can be shown to people.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I ended up standing and coding for about three hours, during which time I managed to dispatch everything on the &amp;quot;boring code&amp;quot; list. Decisions that usually take me hours of consideration were taken in a matter of seconds, logic was simplified as much as possible and absolutely everything that could be turned into a reusable function or class method was. I called it the &amp;quot;Stand-up Hackathon&amp;quot;, and you can probably still see an as-it-happened account on my twitter stream.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The experiment failed miserably on the energy and enthusiasm front. Standing up for three hours, especially in the evening, after a long day, was a bit exhausting. I went home late and got up early, so the next day wasn&amp;#39;t really that productive. Still, it was a success in terms of pushing myself to get stuff done not only through physical discomfort but also through the pressure of having to be able to show something working to people who must have thought I was crazy.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Surely there must be a middle ground somewhere, and I&amp;#39;m going to try and find it.&lt;/div&gt;",

Sure, I was reusing the core of my homebrewed MVC libraries, but because there was some new stuff I wanted to try with the routing and the user authentication and so on, much of the implementation was unique.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, the early stages of a project are always times of unbridled optimist and inspiration. But a lot of it is wasted while coding the foundations. Even trying out that cool new HTTP Auth trick ends up getting boring after a while, for the simple reason that it's got nothing to do with the project's exciting main idea. Which is why lots of really smart people employ mainstream frameworks and/or boilerplate code, in order to get up and running before enthusiasm has a chance to fade. Since I really wanted to develop those boring parts myself, I had a problem.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The night before work on the project was scheduled to start, I went for a drink at my favourite bar and took the laptop along. It was a quiet tuesday night at Pinguim and I meant to try and get some work done in advance.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After sitting at the counter for a while, my good friend the barista suggested I just lay the laptop right there instead of moving to a proper table. Seeing how tall the counter was in relation to the stool I sat upon, the idea was quickly dismissed on ergonomic grounds. However, something else occured to me.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was well aware of the stand-up, a special kind of meeting utilized in agile development processes like scrum. It's timeboxed and help standing up, forcing participants to keep the meeting short and get to the point. The counter, too high to work on while sitting down, was perfectly positioned while standing up. So, I figured, why not try some stand-up programming? So I did. The rules were simple: don't sit down until:&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. The app is able to CRUD users and real estate properties;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. User authentication is handled securely;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. There's a template engine working;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4. I have something that works and can be shown to people.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I ended up standing and coding for about three hours, during which time I managed to dispatch everything on the \"boring code\" list. Decisions that usually take me hours of consideration were taken in a matter of seconds, logic was simplified as much as possible and absolutely everything that could be turned into a reusable function or class method was. I called it the \"Stand-up Hackathon\", and you can probably still see an as-it-happened account on my twitter stream.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The experiment failed miserably on the energy and enthusiasm front. Standing up for three hours, especially in the evening, after a long day, was a bit exhausting. I went home late and got up early, so the next day wasn't really that productive. Still, it was a success in terms of pushing myself to get stuff done not only through physical discomfort but also through the pressure of having to be able to show something working to people who must have thought I was crazy.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Surely there must be a middle ground somewhere, and I'm going to try and find it.&lt;/div&gt;",

    "short_url": "http://post.ly/1dyBL",

    "body_full": "Every now and then, someone questions why we have to use a framework when coding php. That very issue came up on HN a couple days ago: &lt;a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2235507\"&gt;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2235507&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to say the anti-framework camp is on to something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frameworks can be a huge help, and learning one is a great way to learn some best practices and keep an eye on what other coders are doing. This is especially important for people like me who pretty much never work with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, come on. Does every little project really need to be done in Cake or Zend, or whatever? The answer is no. Just as some apps can get by with no database, many don't really benefit from all the features a framework offers. And if that's the case, why go to the trouble?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People like to say they're pragmatic and practical, but that's rarely the case. Frameworks are shiny and cool. Saying you don't use one is heresy. So you learn one, which is fine until you get locked in. When you realise what's going on, you need to justify to yourself why the time investment. So you try to convince others that frameworks are the way to go, regardless of the scope of the work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me? I just learn frameworks because it's a nice way to get to know the work of others, maybe incorporating some practices into my own code.

But first I need to learn my way around CakePHP, the framework I chose for this project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;But why use a framework that&amp;rsquo;s completely new to me, instead of whipping out my own trusty little app engine or simply hacking together a few scripts? After all, my goal is to have CarePinger up and running by tomorrow and the app is indeed very simple. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of challenging myself while learning new stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very familliar with the MVC pattern of course, having coded my own framework around it. However, Cake is far more complete than my own little app engine. As awesome as my work is, I feel that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to learn from exploring the ins and outs of a widely adopted framework. So I&amp;rsquo;m using CarePinger as an excuse to finally get my hands on some Cake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;So yeah. It&amp;rsquo;s half past noon, I want CarePinger to be at least functional by Sunday evening, and I only just downloaded Cake. Time to get moving. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start by reading up on IBM&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/tutorials/os-php-cake1/index.html\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Cook up Web sites fast with CakePHP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;rdquo; 5-part series, and proceed from there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0px;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: x-large;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: medium;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p /&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Sunday has come and gone. It&amp;rsquo;s now Monday and is CarePinger done? Nope. Have I learned CakePHP? Not really, either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;This is what happens when I&amp;rsquo;m too stressed out. My decision-making ability suddenly goes south, and since I&amp;rsquo;m way too stubborn to notice, entire days can be lost to either analysis paralysis or incorrect decisions. Like this past weekend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how it played out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I had this awesome idea last Thursday for a project called CarePinger, which I immediately locked in the &amp;ldquo;really really simple, lol&amp;rdquo; category. I figured it could be done in a few hours, tops, so why not take the opportunity to throw in some learning action as well. That&amp;rsquo;s where Cake came in. I&amp;rsquo;d finally get around to learning CakePHP, and hack a cool project together at the same time. I had nothing to do that weekend, no trips out of town, no paintball games, nothing. It&amp;rsquo;d be nothing but me and my laptop for two days straight. With so much time on my hands, and my learning speed being the stuff of legend, what could possibly go wrong?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;As it turned out, a lot could. A little trip to the shops for some groceries. Cooking lunch and dinner. Caring for my suddenly-ill girlfriend. A hard drive failure. A huge amount of stress from my current job situation. My mind was really not in the right place for some quality learning and coding time, and because I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually plan a schedule, there was never a 1-2h block when I could sit down uninterrupted and work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;But the worst thing was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even stick to the plan. I meant to learn the basics of Cake and then hack out CarePinger on top of it. Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even make it to the end of the first lesson before deciding Cake was far too bloaty a framework for the simple needs of my project, and that maybe I&amp;rsquo;d be better off using something simpler. Only, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to go with the proven framework I use in Threddie. Oh no. I have another one, still in early-ish stages of development, which is really cool because it&amp;rsquo;s a RESTful thing of beauty that&amp;rsquo;s meant to power single-page AJAX apps. It lazy loads everything, has amazing scaffolding capabilities and the only thing that comes out of it is JSON and baby foxes. Obviously, I had to give it a go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;So yeah, by 9pm Saturday evening the plan was already in tatters. Then Roxana had a fever. Work day over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Sunday was even worse because the clock was ticking and for some reason I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had a decent night&amp;rsquo;s sleep. My morning disappeared in a flurry of keyboard strokes as I desperately tried to twist my theoretically perfect RESTful framework into something resembling practical usefulness. The afternoon was even worse. I knew I was melting down when setting up Facebook Connect suddenly seemed impossible. Slowly, I lowered and closed my laptop lid and stepped away from the desk. Five minutes later, I was napping on the couch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;And it was like hitting a reset button. When I woke up, CarePinger no longer sounded like a 4-hour project and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in such a hurry to get it done. CakePHP still seemed bloated as hell, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a hurry to learn it either. The deadlines had been lifted because I realized they never mattered. I realized that learning something new was what was really driving me all along, and the impossibly short timeframe I&amp;rsquo;d allocated was hurting my determination rather than encouraging my resolve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;So I opened IBM&amp;rsquo;s excellent tutorial again, redid the first lesson and then the second. I thought it was going slowly as hell, but the funny thing was, when I looked at the clock barely any time had passed. I was back in the Zone, absorbing knowledge like a motherfucker. CarePinger was never going to get off the ground that weekend, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;At least I got my mind back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Like this past weekend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how it played out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;I had this awesome idea last Thursday for a project called CarePinger, which I immediately locked in the &amp;ldquo;really really simple, lol&amp;rdquo; category. I figured it could be done in a few hours, tops, so why not take the opportunity to throw in some learning action as well. That&amp;rsquo;s where Cake came in. I&amp;rsquo;d finally get around to learning CakePHP, and hack a cool project together at the same time. I had nothing to do that weekend, no trips out of town, no paintball games, nothing. It&amp;rsquo;d be nothing but me and my laptop for two days straight. With so much time on my hands, and my learning speed being the stuff of legend, what could possibly go wrong?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;As it turned out, a lot could. A little trip to the shops for some groceries. Cooking lunch and dinner. Caring for my suddenly-ill girlfriend. A hard drive failure. A huge amount of stress from my current job situation. My mind was really not in the right place for some quality learning and coding time, and because I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually plan a schedule, there was never a 1-2h block when I could sit down uninterrupted and work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;But the worst thing was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even stick to the plan. I meant to learn the basics of Cake and then hack out CarePinger on top of it. Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even make it to the end of the first lesson before deciding Cake was far too bloaty a framework for the simple needs of my project, and that maybe I&amp;rsquo;d be better off using something simpler. Only, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to go with the proven framework I use in Threddie. Oh no. I have another one, still in early-ish stages of development, which is really cool because it&amp;rsquo;s a RESTful thing of beauty that&amp;rsquo;s meant to power single-page AJAX apps. It lazy loads everything, has amazing scaffolding capabilities and the only thing that comes out of it is JSON and baby foxes. Obviously, I had to give it a go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;So yeah, by 9pm Saturday evening the plan was already in tatters. Then Roxana had a fever. Work day over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Sunday was even worse because the clock was ticking and for some reason I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had a decent night&amp;rsquo;s sleep. My morning disappeared in a flurry of keyboard strokes as I desperately tried to twist my theoretically perfect RESTful framework into something resembling practical usefulness. The afternoon was even worse. I knew I was melting down when setting up Facebook Connect suddenly seemed impossible. Slowly, I lowered and closed my laptop lid and stepped away from the desk. Five minutes later, I was napping on the couch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;And it was like hitting a reset button. When I woke up, CarePinger no longer sounded like a 4-hour project and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in such a hurry to get it done. CakePHP still seemed bloated as hell, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a hurry to learn it either. The deadlines had been lifted because I realized they never mattered. I realized that learning something new was what was really driving me all along, and the impossibly short timeframe I&amp;rsquo;d allocated was hurting my determination rather than encouraging my resolve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;So I opened IBM&amp;rsquo;s excellent tutorial again, redid the first lesson and then the second. I thought it was going slowly as hell, but the funny thing was, when I looked at the clock barely any time had passed. I was back in the Zone, absorbing knowledge like a motherfucker. CarePinger was never going to get off the ground that weekend, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;  &lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;At least I got my mind back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But first I need to learn my way around CakePHP, the framework I chose for this project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;But why use a framework that’s completely new to me, instead of whipping out my own trusty little app engine or simply hacking together a few scripts? After all, my goal is to have CarePinger up and running by tomorrow and the app is indeed very simple. Well, it’s a matter of challenging myself while learning new stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m very familliar with the MVC pattern of course, having coded my own framework around it. However, Cake is far more complete than my own little app engine. As awesome as my work is, I feel that there’s a lot to learn from exploring the ins and outs of a widely adopted framework. So I’m using CarePinger as an excuse to finally get my hands on some Cake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;So yeah. It’s half past noon, I want CarePinger to be at least functional by Sunday evening, and I only just downloaded Cake. Time to get moving. I’m going to start by reading up on IBM’s “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/tutorials/os-php-cake1/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cook up Web sites fast with CakePHP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” 5-part series, and proceed from there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s go.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;Sunday has come and gone. It’s now Monday and is CarePinger done? Nope. Have I learned CakePHP? Not really, either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is what happens when I’m too stressed out. My decision-making ability suddenly goes south, and since I’m way too stubborn to notice, entire days can be lost to either analysis paralysis or incorrect decisions.

But around the time FF3.5 came out there were problems with the Evernote plugin. In my case, it stopped working but could not be uninstalled without some dark magic system file editing trickery.

Yes, it's on its way to beat Titanic and become the #1 box office hit, ever. In its fourth weekend in cinemas, Titanic grossed about 28M dollas; Avatar grossed 48 million. It's up to a 1.3 Billion total already, and shows no signs of slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And all this despite currently being the most downloaded movie on Peer to Peer networks. Oddly enough, the movie industry is not complaining much. Why?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Well, first, because the movie is only any good if you strap some 3D glasses on. Otherwise it's little different from Star Wars. If you do watch the 3D version, it becomes much more than a movie. It becomes an experience, something you can't possibly match at home. Not even with a full blown home theatre system, let alone on the measly screen of a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So all those people downloading the crappy pirate version are in for a disappointment. And then comes the kicker.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a brilliant marketing effort that masterfully leveraged the power of social media, anyone who uses Facebook, MySpace or Twitter (and that's like 400M people) knows that Avatar is all about the 3D. Everyone whose friends use social networks knows that Avatar is all about the 3D. The message spread far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So all those P2P downloads of the horrible pirate version actually become the Free part of an awesome Freemium model. You watch it on the laptop. It's crap. But everyone raves about how great it looks on the big screen, especially in 3D. And you look back and wonder \"Well, it does have some sweet scenery\". Next thing you know, not only are you taking your sweetheart to see Avatar at the movies, you're also forking out a few more bucks for the 3D glasses.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Again, a product whose quality is impossible to replicate beats piracy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So chalk one up for marketing, social media, and James Cameron. &lt;br /&gt;And let's hope the movie industry as a whole learns something from this.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Next thing you know, not only are you taking your sweetheart to see Avatar at the movies, you're also forking out a few more bucks for the 3D glasses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Again, a product whose quality is impossible to replicate beats piracy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So chalk one up for marketing, social media, and James Cameron. &lt;br /&gt;And let's hope the movie industry as a whole learns something from this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I work for the online advertising industry, and am therefore up to my neck in tech news. Smartphones in particular are a nightmare. Every other day there's a new state-of-the-art handset which features another megapixel in the camera, or a few more pixels of screen resolution, or maybe voice recognition a cut above the rest, or some marginal advantage like that.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's madness, really, and Google's Android OS just made it all that much worse.

It's fast, has a great camera, smooth web browsing experience, and the Android Market is likely to feed it all the applications you could realistically need.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I already have a phone that does all I need. It's the old-ish iPhone 3G. The best thing about my phone is that it's really, really usable. The next best thing is the App Store, where I can find absolutely anything I could possibly need for my phone. Then there's the killer: I know there will be just one upgrade a year, around June-July. This is key.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm far, far too busy to lose an hour a day reading about the new phone that just came out and has some feature that's marginally better than yesterday's king of the hill. FAR too busy. Plus, it gets bothersome.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPhone gives me all I need, and I only need to lap up the hype once a year when the new one comes out. Call me lazy, but for me, that's great.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the Nexus One, then.\r&lt;br /&gt;Get one if you're already in the market and don't mind finding your phone is no longer the hottest one around in two weeks time. Otherwise, stick with your current smartphone and use the spare time to do something useful.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desire rating:\r&lt;br /&gt;2 stars out of 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

But the TV is on, and something catches my eye. It's the Biography channel, featuring a bio of J.K. Rowling. They're talking about the launch of Harry Potter's final book. They show as millions of fans across the globe waited in line for the launch, one second after midnight GMT in July 21st 2007. Most are children and teenagers, many dressed at characters from the series. After the launch, they eagerly collect their books, some get them signed, and then scoot off to somewhere quiet where they can finally read the long awaited story.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I see images of fourteen year-olds clad in wizard threads, sitting on the street with their friends, each with a very thick book in hand, their eyes completely lost in the pages. The perfect image of how many many kids took the books and opened them as soon as a chance presented itself, anxious as they were to drink the words in.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When an author sells over 300 million copies of her books and statistics show most of the readers are children, you really have to question the wisdom of stating \"children these days don't read\". They do. They just need books that really catches their interest.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As a marketing professional, I find this extremely interesting. I mean, I'm sure there are plenty of novels out there that match or surpass the quality of the boy wizard's tale, and could easily appeal to the same audience. But they have no marketing to speak of, sitting all forgotten and alone in bookstore shelves.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I know many governments have programs to boost readership (we do here in Portugal), but their message is usually just \"read\".&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I remember being a young boy and hating receiving abstract advice. \"Read\" is not a compelling message. \"Read &amp;lt; book name &amp;gt;, people like you find it &amp;lt; comments &amp;gt;.\" is much more appealing and actually stands a chance of working. It did for the Harry series.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Governments cannot favour individual publishers or authors, but there are ways they can avoid it and still make their message less abstract and more effective.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;They just need to hire actual marketeers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But the TV is on, and something catches my eye. It's the Biography channel, featuring a bio of J.K. Rowling. They're talking about the launch of Harry Potter's final book. They show as millions of fans across the globe waited in line for the launch, one second after midnight GMT in July 21st 2007. Most are children and teenagers, many dressed at characters from the series. After the launch, they eagerly collect their books, some get them signed, and then scoot off to somewhere quiet where they can finally read the long awaited story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I see images of fourteen year-olds clad in wizard threads, sitting on the street with their friends, each with a very thick book in hand, their eyes completely lost in the pages. The perfect image of how many many kids took the books and opened them as soon as a chance presented itself, anxious as they were to drink the words in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When an author sells over 300 million copies of her books and statistics show most of the readers are children, you really have to question the wisdom of stating \"children these days don't read\". They do. They just need books that really catches their interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a marketing professional, I find this extremely interesting. I mean, I'm sure there are plenty of novels out there that match or surpass the quality of the boy wizard's tale, and could easily appeal to the same audience. But they have no marketing to speak of, sitting all forgotten and alone in bookstore shelves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I know many governments have programs to boost readership (we do here in Portugal), but their message is usually just \"read\".&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I remember being a young boy and hating receiving abstract advice. \"Read\" is not a compelling message. \"Read , people like you find it .\" is much more appealing and actually stands a chance of working. It did for the Harry series.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Governments cannot favour individual publishers or authors, but there are ways they can avoid it and still make their message less abstract and more effective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They just need to hire actual marketeers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I operated in a tough, saturated market, so being very competitive was important and securing every possible contract never filled my schedule. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays it's a different story. I work a full time job now, one that requires a lot of research and problem solving. I also work with people in three different time zones. Thus the bulk of my waking hours are taken, and what few are left are needed for personal and family matters. Still, I keep the habit of saying \"yes\" to most freelance jobs I still get offered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a nasty effect on my life as a whole. I'm constantly under stress, I have too little time for my girlfriend, I never take an hour to exercise, I've been postponing non-work related projects for years now, and on top of it all I no longer seem to be able to deliver a freelance project on time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ran into trouble with a customer over a blown deadline and, looking at the remaining projects, there are more jobs in a similar situation. So I'm risking my reputation as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to make matters worse, because it takes so long to finish a project, the financial and emotional rewards of completing something are few and far between. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'm starting 2010 by taking a simple new year's resolution: finish the projects I have pending before taking on any new ones. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, even after I do clean my to-do list, I'm going to be very very picky about what jobs I do accept. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, it's about time I started attending those motorcycle driving classes.",
