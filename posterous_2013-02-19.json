I was testing it using the Postman extension for Chrome, sending POST requests to a &lt;em&gt;/users&lt;/em&gt; URI (the Restful way of creating a new user). Here's the request:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\nusername =&amp;gt; myusername\nemail =&amp;gt; email@host.tld\npassword =&amp;gt; 12345\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the controller, I bound the request to the form as usual:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\n...\n$form-&amp;gt;bind($this-&amp;gt;getRequest());\n...\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After which $form-&amp;gt;isValid() promptly failed with an empty $form-&amp;gt;getErrors().&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I spent a good chunk of time hunting down validation problems in the User entity annotations, experimenting with the CSRF token requirement, disabling the JMSSerializerBundle exclusion policies for the User entity and praying to the Gods of the Source. To no avail. I could only get the form to work by manually binding each field:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\n$form-&amp;gt;bind(array(\n'username' =&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;get('username'),\n'email'&amp;nbsp;=&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;get('email'),\n'password'&amp;nbsp;=&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;get('password'),\n));\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;By then I was pretty sure this was deep facepalm country. I find the best way to handle these kinds of situations is to take a break, so I carefully closed the laptop, called it a night and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, this morning the solution hit me as soon as I looked at the code. Quite simply, Symfony expects my POST request to have a top-level namespace matching the form's name. Given the form had the name 'user', it was a simple matter of tweaking the request:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\nuser[username] =&amp;gt; myusername\nuser[email] =&amp;gt; email@host.tld\nuser[password] =&amp;gt; 12345\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done and done.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It's hard to draw a lesson here. On one hand, this wouldn't have happened if I was using a form rendered by Symfony rather than crafting my request by hand. Since the &lt;a href=\"http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; assumes you'll be doing just that, it doesn't bother too much with explaining how things work under the veneer of the helpers and that makes life difficult when building an API that's not going to be consumed by something built with Symfony. On the other hand, maybe I could have started my debugging by having symfony build a valid form and looking at the request it produced. Then again, hindsight is 20/20.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the only sure conclusion is that, yet again, walking away from the code and coming back well rested works wonders.&lt;/p&gt;",

The objective was to consolidate my at-home time, working on personal projects first thing in the morning rather than in the evening. This makes sense because I'm rarely in the mood to be productive after a long day at the office.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I pulled it off for a while, and it was great. Days were much simpler: wake up, work on my stuff, work at the office, relax, sleep. Much better than wake up, work at the office, fret about not having the energy to work on my stuff, don't relax at all, sleep. Knowing that each day I could get work done on my own projects greatly improved my mood, which had a positive impact on my demeanor and productivity at the office too.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sadly, going out of sync relative to one's significant other is not easy. Readjusting sleep patterns is hard enough, trying to go to sleep while someone still roams around the house is harder still. By the end of the week I found myself&nbsp;somewhat sleep-deprived. I was also missing my quality time with her.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So now I'm back to old slightly chaotic routine.&lt;/div&gt;",

Or is it?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Trouble is, web development these days is all about frameworks. Take a look at the file structure of any project and you&amp;#39;ll guess the framework it is built upon before you get any clue about its purpose. This reliance on frameworks has heavily leaked into testing. Even if you&amp;#39;re just testing a Symfony2 service, you&amp;#39;re still parsing tons of yaml files and booting up the kernel and injecting dependencies and god knows what else before your service is actually tested. This slows each test quite a lot, which is troublesome if your suite runs hundreds or thousands of tests.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;TDD is based on the idea that you write your test first, just enough to prevent the suite from passing. Then you implement some code that makes the test pass. Then you refactor that code so that its cleaner and more efficient. In between these steps you should run your test suite. An entire &amp;quot;write test, run tests, write code, run tests, refactor code&amp;quot; (the Red-Green-Refactor cycle) should take no more than a couple of minutes, which is difficult when justs running the tests takes an hour.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The answer is moving application logic away from the framework.

That's because checking the weather is as easy as tapping once on the weather app icon, whereas taking a note or creating a reminder is a complex, keyboard-heavy operation.

In a time when the browser is perhaps the application we use the most, it's quite harmful to persist using a technology that's known for crashing it and slowing it down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It's true Flash is still better suited than HTML5 for certain tasks, and its ubiquity as a video player makes it unavoidable for consumers to keep running it, but the times they are a-chagnin'. If I were a Flash dev, I'd be looking at some HTML5 and JS tutorials right about now.&lt;/p&gt;",

If this had gotten any traction, facebook, google+ and foursquare feeds would also have been integrated into the system to make it more reliable. SMS notifications would be used in addition to email warnings too.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s only been two days since the launch, but the analytics panel makes for some grim reading already.

I crept out of bed, out of the warmth of Her presence, and tentatively stepped away. My idea needed to be made manifest quickly, lest it be forgotten. Treading lightly on the cold wooden floor, I made my way to the living room, sat on a couch by the window and picked up the laptop.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;As dawn came, the preliminary work was done. It was nothing but a sketch made of computer code, but it was enough. My idea had taken root. As I went back to the bedroom, my thoughts traveled a year into the past. In that same house my grandmother still dwelt. In another city, one of my dearest friends still lived. How could we possibly have known.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Less than a week has passed since that chilly Saturday morning. Work has progressed swiftly. I just uploaded a little &lt;a href=\"http://absenceletters.com\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, in fact, and created an account for myself in it. Every once in a while, a program will run on its server and send me an email. I&amp;#39;ll click a link in it and nothing will happen. One day, though, I won&amp;#39;t click on that link. I don&amp;#39;t know when or why. Surely it&amp;#39;ll be in the distant future. But it will come. And when it does, another little program will take the letters I&amp;#39;ve stored in its database and send them one by one.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;And hopefully the people I love will find some comfort in them.&lt;/div&gt;",

Treading lightly on the cold wooden floor, I made my way to the living room, sat on a couch by the window and picked up the laptop.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;As dawn came, the preliminary work was done. It was nothing but a sketch made of computer code, but it was enough. My idea had taken root. As I went back to the bedroom, my thoughts traveled a year into the past.

I just uploaded a little &lt;a href=\"http://absenceletters.com\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, in fact, and created an account for myself in it. Every once in a while, a program will run on its server and send me an email. I&amp;#39;ll click a link in it and nothing will happen. One day, though, I won&amp;#39;t click on that link. I don&amp;#39;t know when or why. Surely it&amp;#39;ll be in the distant future. But it will come. And when it does, another little program will take the letters I&amp;#39;ve stored in its database and send them one by one.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;And hopefully the people I love will find some comfort in them.&lt;/div&gt;",

A cidade estava a enlouquecer. Era muito estranha, muito estranha, a passividade de quem deveria estar a manter a ordem. Mas era ainda mais estranho que ningu&amp;eacute;m o tivesse vindo visitar &amp;agrave; sua loja de banda desenhada e artigos festivos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;A cortina deteve-se com um estrondo e o som ecoou pelos corredores vazios, demorando a extinguir-se nas profundezas da galeria comercial mal iluminada que, hoje, cheirava pior que de costume.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mas ser&amp;aacute;, realmente? Assim t&amp;atilde;o estranho?&amp;rdquo;, pensou. J&amp;aacute; n&amp;atilde;o eram os anos oitenta. Olhou para baixo, para os p&amp;eacute;s. Antigamente t&amp;ecirc;-los-ia visto, mas agora eram escondidos pela camisola, inchada como um bal&amp;atilde;o. Deu uma leve palmada no est&amp;ocirc;mago e esbo&amp;ccedil;ou um esgar, que de sorriso tinha pouco. Como o tempo passava. Como os clich&amp;eacute;s se concretizavam. Abanou a cabe&amp;ccedil;a.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Com o tilintar de chaves e um estalido, a fechadura ficou trancada. A cortina n&amp;atilde;o subiria de novo at&amp;eacute; &amp;agrave; tarde do dia seguinte. Disso o lojista tinha a certeza. N&amp;atilde;o parecia, mas era uma estrutura altamente refor&amp;ccedil;ada.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Contemplou a soma da sua vida. Tinha tomado conta da loja aos trinta anos, pensando tratar-se de um grande neg&amp;oacute;cio. Sempre tinha gostado de banda desenhada, portanto que melhor ideia que fazer disso vida? Trabalharia ali sozinho para come&amp;ccedil;ar, depois empregaria ajudantes e finalmente expandiria para outros locais. Em menos de dez anos teria liberdade financeira e poderia dedicar-se aos seus outros interesses no abundante tempo livre. Se perguntassem ao lojista onde exactamente &amp;eacute; que esse plano tinha corrido mal, ele n&amp;atilde;o saberia dizer. N&amp;atilde;o havia um momento ao qual fosse &amp;oacute;bvio apontar o dedo e dizer &amp;ldquo;foi aqui&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Suspirou. Tudo que tinha havido era uma inocente sucess&amp;atilde;o de dias, todos iguais uns aos outros. Dias que, individualmente inofensivos, tinham-se acumulado rapidamente e, de alguma forma, resultado num grande e assustador monstro feito de tempo e desapontamento. O lojista tinha hoje quase sessenta anos. Sem filhos, e com plena consci&amp;ecirc;ncia de que a loja na galeria moribunda estava a pouco tempo de desaparecer, n&amp;atilde;o deixaria grande legado.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Olhou para a esquerda, por cima do ombro, na direc&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o de uma montra esparsamente povoada por caixas velhas de videojogos. Sim, o mundo tinha mudado muito. J&amp;aacute; quase ningu&amp;eacute;m vinha &amp;agrave; sua loja pela banda desenhada, pelas figuras articuladas ou pelos jogos de tabuleiro. O pouco que vendia era pela internet, e os magros lucros disso ainda tinham que ser partilhados com o rapaz que lhe tratava da p&amp;aacute;gina, ou site, ou l&amp;aacute; como se chamava aquilo. Se n&amp;atilde;o fosse pelos artigos festivos, particularmente os pirot&amp;eacute;cnicos, estaria a viver em Passos Manuel dentro de uma caixa de cart&amp;atilde;o.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Um passo ligeiro, denunciado pelo mais leve dos sons, arrancou-o da contempla&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o e atirou-o de volta &amp;agrave; realidade. Tinha aprendido a estar atento, gra&amp;ccedil;as aos clientes que n&amp;atilde;o lhe visitavam a loja pelos super her&amp;oacute;is. Num piscar de olhos, levou a m&amp;atilde;o ao interior do sobretudo e soltou a mola do coldre que sempre o acompanhava. Agarrou a coronha e virou-se para a direita, de onde ouvira o passo. Deu com duas figuras de p&amp;eacute; &amp;agrave; sua frente, nem a tr&amp;ecirc;s metros de dist&amp;acirc;ncia. Um fedor a carne podre invadiu-lhe as narinas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Sentiu os p&amp;ecirc;los da nuca a eri&amp;ccedil;arem-se. Estava habituado a receber gente muito esquisita, mas estes dois pareciam sa&amp;iacute;dos da selva. Roupas escuras todas rasgadas, manchadas de vermelho enferrujado, revelavam uma variedade de cortes, escoria&amp;ccedil;&amp;otilde;es e feridas abertas. E aquele cheiro? Revoltava o est&amp;ocirc;mago. Teve que fazer um grande esfor&amp;ccedil;o para n&amp;atilde;o vomitar ali mesmo. Moveu os p&amp;eacute;s para manter o equil&amp;iacute;brio, vacilou e encostou-se &amp;agrave; cortina de metal em busca de apoio. Olhou melhor para os seus inesperados visitantes, que n&amp;atilde;o se mexiam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;Um era moreno, de estatura m&amp;eacute;dia, e olhava-o com interesse. A outra, apoiada com evidente dificuldade no seu bra&amp;ccedil;o, era uma loira platinada cujo cabelo extremamente longo e sujo cobria o rosto. Os dedos finos e longos da sua m&amp;atilde;o direita eram brancos como giz e terminavam em unhas de um vermelho demasiado vivo. Tinha-as cravadas no bra&amp;ccedil;o do ajudante com o que parecia a &amp;uacute;ltima for&amp;ccedil;a que lhe restava. Como &amp;eacute; que aqueles dois tinham conseguido aproximar-se dele sem fazer qualquer barulho, o lojista n&amp;atilde;o percebia. Contudo, &amp;agrave; excep&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o daquele &amp;uacute;ltimo passo, permaneciam completamente silenciosos. E aquele cheiro, seria ele o &amp;uacute;nico a senti-lo?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;O vistante desviou subitamente o olhar do lojista e concentrou-se na mulher que acompanhava. O lojista tamb&amp;eacute;m a fixou, cativado por uma qualquer atrac&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o irresist&amp;iacute;vel. Vou-a levantar a custo a cabe&amp;ccedil;a, o cabelo pastoso apartando-se ligeiramente, revelando um rosto assustador. A pele, de um branco marm&amp;oacute;reo, era oleosa e atravessada por veias como varizes, muito evidentes e muito azuis. Os olhos que o fitavam, apesar de negros e encovados, brilhavam intensamente e havia neles um ar de reconhecimento. O lojista largou a arma e abriu a boca para falar. A voz falhou-lhe. Aquela mulher, ele conhecia-a. Conhecia-a muito bem e h&amp;aacute; muito tempo. Mas nunca a tinha visto assim, naquele estado. Tinha dificuldade em crer nos pr&amp;oacute;prios olhos. Mas n&amp;atilde;o havia d&amp;uacute;vida, era ela.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;Acirc;ngela!&amp;rdquo;, exclamou por fim. Ela esbo&amp;ccedil;ou um sorriso que, revelando dentes amarelados e pontiagudos entre l&amp;aacute;bios finos e negros era mais assustador que amistoso, e respondeu numa voz &amp;aacute;spera e muito sumida.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ol&amp;aacute;, Pistolas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;",

A cidade estava a enlouquecer. Era muito estranha, muito estranha, a passividade de quem deveria estar a manter a ordem. Mas era ainda mais estranho que ninguém o tivesse vindo visitar à sua loja de banda desenhada e artigos festivos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;A cortina deteve-se com um estrondo e o som ecoou pelos corredores vazios, demorando a extinguir-se nas profundezas da galeria comercial mal iluminada que, hoje, cheirava pior que de costume.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Mas será, realmente? Assim tão estranho?”, pensou. Já não eram os anos oitenta. Olhou para baixo, para os pés. Antigamente tê-los-ia visto, mas agora eram escondidos pela camisola, inchada como um balão. Deu uma leve palmada no estômago e esboçou um esgar, que de sorriso tinha pouco. Como o tempo passava. Como os clichés se concretizavam. Abanou a cabeça.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Com o tilintar de chaves e um estalido, a fechadura ficou trancada. A cortina não subiria de novo até à tarde do dia seguinte. Disso o lojista tinha a certeza. Não parecia, mas era uma estrutura altamente reforçada.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contemplou a soma da sua vida. Tinha tomado conta da loja aos trinta anos, pensando tratar-se de um grande negócio. Sempre tinha gostado de banda desenhada, portanto que melhor ideia que fazer disso vida? Trabalharia ali sozinho para começar, depois empregaria ajudantes e finalmente expandiria para outros locais. Em menos de dez anos teria liberdade financeira e poderia dedicar-se aos seus outros interesses no abundante tempo livre. Se perguntassem ao lojista onde exactamente é que esse plano tinha corrido mal, ele não saberia dizer. Não havia um momento ao qual fosse óbvio apontar o dedo e dizer “foi aqui”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suspirou. Tudo que tinha havido era uma inocente sucessão de dias, todos iguais uns aos outros. Dias que, individualmente inofensivos, tinham-se acumulado rapidamente e, de alguma forma, resultado num grande e assustador monstro feito de tempo e desapontamento. O lojista tinha hoje quase sessenta anos. Sem filhos, e com plena consciência de que a loja na galeria moribunda estava a pouco tempo de desaparecer, não deixaria grande legado.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Olhou para a esquerda, por cima do ombro, na direcção de uma montra esparsamente povoada por caixas velhas de videojogos. Sim, o mundo tinha mudado muito. Já quase ninguém vinha à sua loja pela banda desenhada, pelas figuras articuladas ou pelos jogos de tabuleiro. O pouco que vendia era pela internet, e os magros lucros disso ainda tinham que ser partilhados com o rapaz que lhe tratava da página, ou site, ou lá como se chamava aquilo. Se não fosse pelos artigos festivos, particularmente os pirotécnicos, estaria a viver em Passos Manuel dentro de uma caixa de cartão.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Um passo ligeiro, denunciado pelo mais leve dos sons, arrancou-o da contemplação e atirou-o de volta à realidade. Tinha aprendido a estar atento, graças aos clientes que não lhe visitavam a loja pelos super heróis. Num piscar de olhos, levou a mão ao interior do sobretudo e soltou a mola do coldre que sempre o acompanhava. Agarrou a coronha e virou-se para a direita, de onde ouvira o passo. Deu com duas figuras de pé à sua frente, nem a três metros de distância. Um fedor a carne podre invadiu-lhe as narinas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sentiu os pêlos da nuca a eriçarem-se. Estava habituado a receber gente muito esquisita, mas estes dois pareciam saídos da selva. Roupas escuras todas rasgadas, manchadas de vermelho enferrujado, revelavam uma variedade de cortes, escoriações e feridas abertas. E aquele cheiro? Revoltava o estômago. Teve que fazer um grande esforço para não vomitar ali mesmo. Moveu os pés para manter o equilíbrio, vacilou e encostou-se à cortina de metal em busca de apoio. Olhou melhor para os seus inesperados visitantes, que não se mexiam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Um era moreno, de estatura média, e olhava-o com interesse. A outra, apoiada com evidente dificuldade no seu braço, era uma loira platinada cujo cabelo extremamente longo e sujo cobria o rosto. Os dedos finos e longos da sua mão direita eram brancos como giz e terminavam em unhas de um vermelho demasiado vivo. Tinha-as cravadas no braço do ajudante com o que parecia a última força que lhe restava. Como é que aqueles dois tinham conseguido aproximar-se dele sem fazer qualquer barulho, o lojista não percebia. Contudo, à excepção daquele último passo, permaneciam completamente silenciosos. E aquele cheiro, seria ele o único a senti-lo?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;O vistante desviou subitamente o olhar do lojista e concentrou-se na mulher que acompanhava. O lojista também a fixou, cativado por uma qualquer atracção irresistível. Vou-a levantar a custo a cabeça, o cabelo pastoso apartando-se ligeiramente, revelando um rosto assustador. A pele, de um branco marmóreo, era oleosa e atravessada por veias como varizes, muito evidentes e muito azuis. Os olhos que o fitavam, apesar de negros e encovados, brilhavam intensamente e havia neles um ar de reconhecimento. O lojista largou a arma e abriu a boca para falar. A voz falhou-lhe. Aquela mulher, ele conhecia-a. Conhecia-a muito bem e há muito tempo. Mas nunca a tinha visto assim, naquele estado. Tinha dificuldade em crer nos próprios olhos. Mas não havia dúvida, era ela.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ângela!”, exclamou por fim. Ela esboçou um sorriso que, revelando dentes amarelados e pontiagudos entre lábios finos e negros era mais assustador que amistoso, e respondeu numa voz áspera e muito sumida.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Olá, Pistolas.”&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
