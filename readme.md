# The Blog


## About

This is the source code to my blog, usually located at http://blog.pedrogilcandeias.com .

When Posterous announced it was to shut down, I decided it was time to move to a lighter, simpler (there's a trend here) blogging system that let me write in Markdown. So I made this one.

It runs on custom php code, similar in form to microframeworks like Slim or Silex but with no unused features. It's little more than a routing system and a thin wrapper around MongoDB. It's lightweight and very fast.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.3
* MongoDB
